I"^<p>Unfortunately, the 
drivers to support Internet via USB on the BeagleBone Green (BBG) 
(see <a href="https://beagleboard.org/getting-started">Getting Started</a>) cannot be
installed on the latest version of MacOS (Iâ€™m using Big Sur 11.2.1).
This post should also work for other Beaglebone
Boards like the Pocket Beagle or BeagleBone Black.</p>
