I"<p>A camping trip with Warren to the Hawkesbury has become an annual event (e.g. in <a href="http://phwl.org/hawkesbury-river-2014/">2014</a>). Unfortunately, we couldnâ€™t do it this year but went for a day trip, which was also our first fishing trip there in the <a href="http://phwl.org/stacer-outlaw-429/">new boat</a>. A 6:30am start and not a touch until about noon. Then we caught a couple of flathead and a bream in about 30 min, narrowly avoiding a doughnut.</p>
