I"ß<p>I have been using <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> for many years.
It produces good looking websites and is easy to install and maintain.
Unfortunately, it isnâ€™t easy at all to backup the website, and the
interface is all web-based meaning it is difficult to create
scripts which update the website. 
I will be switching them over at some point and moved the old
domain to a spare <a href="http://uxa.apl.mybluehost.me/">http://uxa.apl.mybluehost.me/</a>.</p>
