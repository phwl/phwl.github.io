<p>Like many companies, it appears that they donâ€™t exist any more, and
the current versions are badged under
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00149ZVTG">Bostitch</a>.  Wired
had a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/10/paperpro-makes-quite-possibly-the-best-staplers-ever/">blog
post</a>
on the PaperPro , referencing Office Supply Geekâ€™s
<a href="http://officesupplygeek.com/desk-accessories/paper-fasteners/paperpro-staplers-quite-possibly-the-best-staplers-ever/">review</a>
(and with a name like that you would expect them to take their
staplers seriously) says it is one of the best staplers ever.</p>

<p>The reason they are good is because they employ a spring to drive the 
stapler through the paper. The earliest patent for a spring loaded
stapler appears to be
<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7681771B2">US7681771B2 Stapler</a>
which is relatively recent (2006).</p>
