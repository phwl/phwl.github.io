I"æ	<p>An awesome fishing report thatÂ Michael Zhu sent to me via Facebook Messenger.</p>

<p>Dear Phil, our group ofÂ four people boarded Brainâ€™s chart boat (big boat licensed for 15- standard package of 8 person) at Jerseyville, South West Rocks. We had one Aussie, two Swedish men and me. Here is a photo of us at 6am this morning.</p>

<p>We collectedÂ  Slimy mackerel at the bait ground - while we catching bait fish I got two striped tuna. Boat traveled along the coast line to near grassy head adjacent to continent shelf with water depth ~30m.</p>

<p>Live slimy mackerel was very effective. In 10 minutes we managed to catch ourÂ 1st big mackerel and within one hour we caught average 3 mackerel each. We lost a couple as well. One Swedish guy took a little long time fish getting it in, this resulting in a â€œhaircutâ€ by a shark!</p>

<p>At 10am we moved to a depth of 55m for bottom fish but we didnâ€™t do much good â€¦2 Sergeant Bakers a couple of ocean flathead andÂ a red rock cod. I caught a school mackerel.</p>

<p>When we returned to jetty at noon, another chart boat that was targeting Jewfish caught twoâ€¦</p>
