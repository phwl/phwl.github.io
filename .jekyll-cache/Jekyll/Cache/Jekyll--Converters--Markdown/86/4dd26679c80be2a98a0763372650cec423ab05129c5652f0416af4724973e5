<p>Note that the Linux GPIO interface was updated in 2020. Here is a link
to a website explaining the changes
<a href="https://microhobby.com.br/blog/2020/02/02/new-linux-kernel-5-5-new-interfaces-in-gpiolib/">https://microhobby.com.br/blog/2020/02/02/new-linux-kernel-5-5-new-interfaces-in-gpiolib/</a>. That means that many tutorials on the web are either obsolete or 
wonâ€™t work with current kernels. The peripheral used in the
qemu_aarch64_virt machine is described in the
