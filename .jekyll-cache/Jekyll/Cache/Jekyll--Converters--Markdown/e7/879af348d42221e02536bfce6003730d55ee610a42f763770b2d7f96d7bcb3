I"Î<p>My mother bought this Marantz 74CD67 CD player in 1996. Twenty years later, it was unable to read reliably.</p>

This comprehensive list of CD player mechanisms atÂ [http://www.dutchaudioclassics.nl/philips_cdm_cd_mechanism_list/](http://www.dutchaudioclassics.nl/philips_cdm_cd_mechanism_list/)Â ([local copy](/assets/images/2018/11/DutchAudioClassics.nl-Information-specifications-photos-and-service-manuals-of-Philips-Marantz-TDA1541-cd-players.pdf)) showed I needed a Philips CDM12.1 mechanism. This was easy to find on ebay as a "VAM1201 VAM1202 CDM12.1 CDM12.2 laser transport mechanism for Philips NEW". Total cost with free shipping from Hong Kong was $13.

I also found this detailed guideÂ to replacing the laser mechanism [https://www.hifigear.co.uk/blog/marantz-cd63se-laser-transport-mechanism-replacement/](https://www.hifigear.co.uk/blog/marantz-cd63se-laser-transport-mechanism-replacement/)Â and the [Marantz-CD-67-SE-Service-Manual](/assets/images/2018/11/Marantz-CD-67-SE-Service-Manual.pdf) (which wasn't that helpful for this particular repair).

Here is the player opened up.

Undo the three connectors and unscrew the CD assembly.<figure class="">

There is another connector for the daughter board.<figure class="">

The new and old look very similar.<figure class="">

In fact, at this point I was very pleased I took the previous photo so I could double check I didn't mix up the old and new mechanisms :-)<figure class="">

Put it back together and it works! Hopefully good for another 20 years.
