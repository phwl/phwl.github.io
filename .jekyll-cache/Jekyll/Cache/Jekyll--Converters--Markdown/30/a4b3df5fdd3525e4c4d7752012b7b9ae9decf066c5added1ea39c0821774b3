I"<p>I have been using <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> for many years.
It produces good looking websites and is easy to install and maintain.
Unfortunately, it isnâ€™t easy at all to backup the website, and the
interface is all web-based meaning it is difficult to create
scripts which update the website. The old website is <a href="http://phwl.org/blog">http://phwl.org/blog</a>
and the new website can be viewed at <a href="https://phwl.github.io">https://phwl.github.io</a>.
I will be switching them over at some point.</p>
