<p><strong>International Conference on Field Programmable Technology</strong>
<strong>Naha, Okinawa</strong> <a href="http://www.fpt18.sakura.ne.jp/workshop.html">http://www.fpt18.sakura.ne.jp/workshop.html</a>
<strong>December 14, 2018 (afternoon)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Organisers: David Boland and Philip Leong, The University of Sydney</strong></p>

<p>This workshop will provide a forum to discuss technical challenges and product opportunities for applying deep learning within embedded systems that take advantage of the energy and latency benefits offered by field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In particular, the following questions will be addressed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Is current academic research addressing the needs of industry? What are the new research problems important to them?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the new markets and applications created by FPGA-based machine learning?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will FPGAs be able to capture a significant marketshare, or will hardware-accelerated machine learning be consolidated such that application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are the preferred solution?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The format is a 2-hour panel session with guests representing industry and academia. Each speaker will be given 10-15 minutes to briefly state their positions regarding the above questions. We will then open the floor to questions from the audience, which we expect to lead to engaging discussions.</p>

<p>We hope that by attending this workshop you will learn about new embedded applications that could benefit from the use of FPGA accelerated machine learning, as well as the technical challenges that need to be addressed in order to make this a reality. Furthermore, by gathering likeminded individuals, this workshop provides an opportunity to develop collaborations with panellists or other attendees.</p>
