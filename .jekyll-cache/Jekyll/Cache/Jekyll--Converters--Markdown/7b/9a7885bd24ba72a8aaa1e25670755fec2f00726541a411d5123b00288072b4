I"‘	<p>My mother bought this Marantz 74CD67 CD player in 1996. Twenty years later, it was unable to read reliably.</p>

<p>This comprehensive list of CD player mechanisms atÂ <a href="http://www.dutchaudioclassics.nl/philips_cdm_cd_mechanism_list/">http://www.dutchaudioclassics.nl/philips_cdm_cd_mechanism_list/</a>Â (<a href="/assets/images/2018/11/DutchAudioClassics.nl-Information-specifications-photos-and-service-manuals-of-Philips-Marantz-TDA1541-cd-players.pdf">local copy</a>) showed I needed a Philips CDM12.1 mechanism. This was easy to find on ebay as a â€œVAM1201 VAM1202 CDM12.1 CDM12.2 laser transport mechanism for Philips NEWâ€. Total cost with free shipping from Hong Kong was $13.</p>

<p>I also found this detailed guideÂ to replacing the laser mechanism <a href="https://www.hifigear.co.uk/blog/marantz-cd63se-laser-transport-mechanism-replacement/">https://www.hifigear.co.uk/blog/marantz-cd63se-laser-transport-mechanism-replacement/</a>Â and the <a href="/assets/images/2018/11/Marantz-CD-67-SE-Service-Manual.pdf">Marantz-CD-67-SE-Service-Manual</a> (which wasnâ€™t that helpful for this particular repair).</p>

<p>Here is the player opened up.</p>

<p>Undo the three connectors and unscrew the CD assembly.<img src="/assets/images/2018/11/40784864_Unknown.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>There is another connector for the daughter board.<img src="/assets/images/2018/11/40784880_Unknown.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>The CD mechanism in its plastic sled.<img src="/assets/images/2018/11/40784928_Unknown.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>The new and old look very similar.<img src="/assets/images/2018/11/40784960_Unknown.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>In fact, at this point I was very pleased I took the previous photo so I could double check I didnâ€™t mix up the old and new mechanisms :-)<img src="/assets/images/2018/11/40784976_Unknown.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>Put it back together and it works! Hopefully good for another 20 years.</p>
