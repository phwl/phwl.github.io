<p>Fortunately, it was not serious. The fuel line had fallen off the tank and
we were soon underway again.</p>

<p>Caught a nice flathead on the second drift..</p>

<p>We were being blown straight into shore so we dropped the anchor and had
coffee while fishing.</p>

<p>Not much was happening so we were back around midday, just as the wind was
picking up (later in the day it was 40 km/h).</p>

<p>At the boat ramp Warren kindly gave our remaining nippers to some guys
heading out from the boat ramp. He didnâ€™t realise they were from a 
bait shop :-)
This pelican was well fed, took a flathead frame but didnâ€™t want any more.</p>
