I"N<p>For many years I’ve been using a convoluted process to generate my 
<a href="/assets/papers">publications list</a> from separate BibTex files for
journals, conferences, books, patents, etc. I thought I could do it
using <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>, but it doesn’t appear that it
parses bibtex files correctly.</p>
