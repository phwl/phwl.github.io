<p>We got there early afternoon on a Friday and set up camp. Here we are outside Beardâ€™s tent.</p>

<p>Then we fished the beach for the afternoon. Although we saw fish in the waves, we also saw dolphins which is never a good omen for fishing.</p>

<p>The entire Sat and Sunday was really windy. Halfway through the night I heard a loud snap, which is never good.</p>

<p>On the Sat morning there was an amazing amount of bird and dolphin activity. We fished for 2 solid days without a fish.</p>

<p>On the Sunday morning, my float went down and I struck. I was probably more surprised than the fish.</p>
