<p>I didnâ€™t want to repair this at first since Apple no longer supports
operating system updates, but I had an old 2TB Seagate backup disk that should
work just fine. I always liked the beautiful design, display and speakers in
an iMac (even though it runs hot and noisy and is a pain to repair). 
iFixit has a set of instructions (

<p>The non-obvious step is how to open the case. It is held in with magnets
and you need a glass lifter remove the front glass assembly. Mine was from

<p>There are 4 screws down each vertical edge of the display assembly
(8 in total). Remove those with tweezers and a T10 Torx driver.
The display assembly fits tightly in the case. I used a right
angle pick to get under the assembly and first lift up the top left
hand side, and then the top right hand side.</p>

<p>Next remove the connector for the shortest cable so you can tilt the display.</p>

<p>Remove the the two 
T20 screws that secure the hard disk assembly to the iMac and remove
the connectors.</p>

<p>Replace the drive and put everything back together.  After I did
this, the display didnâ€™t work.  Unscrewed the thing again, played
around with the connector, and things came alive again!</p>

<p>Next you need to download the High Sierra image (the latest version
of MacOS that supports this machine) <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT208969">https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT208969</a>.
Then simply boot from the USB and install to the hard disk.</p>
