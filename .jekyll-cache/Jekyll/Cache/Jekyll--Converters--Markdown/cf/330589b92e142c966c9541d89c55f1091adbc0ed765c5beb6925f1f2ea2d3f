I"a<p>The 1 million hectare Blue Mountains is a World Heritage listed National Park in NSW Australia. Its name comes from the blueish haze that often appears above it due to evaporation of eucalyptus oil from the trees.</p>

<p>Here is a wide-angle view of the Three Sisters, Mount Solitary and Jamieson Valley from Katoomba.</p>

<p>The most easily recognisable rock formation is the Three Sisters. Legend has it that three suitors were not allowed to marry three beautiful sisters as they were from a rival tribe. A war ensued and the sisters were turned to stone by a witchdoctor in order to protect them. Unfortunately, the witchdoctor was killed and could not turn them back as he originally intended. The stone monument is a reminder for future generations.</p>

<p>You can walk down the 900 steps of the Giant Stairwell at Echo Point and across to the Scenic World train. On the way, you pass Katoomba Falls.</p>
