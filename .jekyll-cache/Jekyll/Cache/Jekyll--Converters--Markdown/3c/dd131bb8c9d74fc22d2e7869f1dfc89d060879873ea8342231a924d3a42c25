I"ô<p>Wandering around <a href="http://www.allabouthongkong.com/?p=644">Sim City</a> in Hong Kong, a mint Fujifilm X100T jumped out and emptied my wallet.Â This is the first digital camera I really like as it is small, quiet and fast, making it really pleasant to use. The experience is not unlikeÂ joining a cult.<a href="/assets/images/2017/04/DSCF4152.jpg">
