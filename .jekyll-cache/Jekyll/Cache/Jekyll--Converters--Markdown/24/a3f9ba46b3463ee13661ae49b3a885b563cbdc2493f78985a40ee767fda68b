<p>Today on the operating table we have a mid-2011 iMac with a dead hard disk.
I didnâ€™t want to repair this at first since Apple no longer supports
operating system updates, but I had an old 2TB Seagate backup disk that should
work just fine. Moreover, I always liked the beautiful industrial design
of an iMac.</p>

<p>iFixit has a set of instructions (

<p>The non-obvious step is how to open the case. It is held in with magnets
and you need a glass lifter remove the front glass assembly. Mine was from
Harbour Freight <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/dual-cup-suction-lifter-46134.html">https://www.harborfreight.com/dual-cup-suction-lifter-46134.html</a>. There are 4 screws down each vertical edge. Remove those with tweezers
and a T10 Torx driver.</p>

<p>The display assembly has a tight fit to the case. I used a right angle pick
to get under the assembly and first lift up the top left hand side, and then
the top right hand side.</p>

<p>Next remove the connector for the shortest cable so you can tilt the display.</p>
