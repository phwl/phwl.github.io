<p>Elsa Dreisig making her Covent Garden debut as Pamina was fabulous

<p>I waited for a good day and took the Victoria Line to the Tate
Modern. There is an excellent viewing platform on the top floor.</p>

<p>This north-west view has One Blackfriers on the left, then the Blackfriers Bridge, St Paulâ€™s Cathedral just right of center, and the chimney of the Tate Modern on the right.</p>
