<p>There were many highlights to this visit. Chen Shuai kindly accompanied me to visit the former residence of Soong Ching Ling, Sun Yat-senâ€™s wife (we also went to Sun Yat-senâ€™s former residence but that was not as interesting).</p>

<p>Soong Ching Ling was someone I greatly admire, She had friends like Stalin, who gave her this car.</p>
