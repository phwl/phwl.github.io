I"é<p>Luderick (otherwise known as blackfish) are among my favourite targets as they areÂ quite plentiful in Sydney Harbour and the fishing is very visual. The rigÂ involves a green weed or sea lettuce on a size 8 hook below a quill float which is carefully balanced with a few split shot. A 10 ft whippy rod and sidecast reel makes up the tackle needed for this type of fishing. Beard called me up the day before to see if I wanted to go fishing, so we made a plan to meet the next day.</p>
