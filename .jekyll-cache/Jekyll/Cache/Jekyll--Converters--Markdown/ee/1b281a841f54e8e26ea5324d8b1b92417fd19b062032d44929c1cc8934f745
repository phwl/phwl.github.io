I"}<p>The 3rd annual FPGA Fly Fishing Workshop (FFFâ€™17) was down on attendance, only Ken and myself participating from the 19-20th Feb, 2017. This year, it was on the Trinity River, California, fishing for steelhead (sea run rainbow trout). These are a reasonably hard fish to catch, one fish being a good result. Arrived at about 10am at SFO and was met by Ken at the airport.</p>
