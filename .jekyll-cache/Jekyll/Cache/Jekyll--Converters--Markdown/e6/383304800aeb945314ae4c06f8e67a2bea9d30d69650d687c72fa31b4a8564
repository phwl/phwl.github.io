I"{<p>Today on the operating table we have a mid-2011 iMac with a dead hard disk.
I didnâ€™t want to repair this at first since Apple no longer supports
operating system updates, but I had an old 2TB Seagate backup disk that should
work just fine. I always liked the beautiful design, display and speakers in
an iMac (even though it runs hot and noisy and is a pain to repair).</p>
