I"Ò<p>Luderick (otherwise known as blackfish) are among my favourite targets as they areÂ quite plentiful in Sydney Harbour and the fishing is very visual. The rigÂ involves a green weed or sea lettuce on a size 8 hook below a quill float which is carefully balanced with a few split shot. A 10 ft whippy rod and sidecast reel makes up the tackle needed for this type of fishing. Beard called me up the day before to see if I wanted to go fishing, so we made a plan to meet the next day.</p>

<p>Then there was plenty of action with these two resulting from a double hookup (one of two double hookups for the day).</p>

<p>The keeper net was starting to get full. Shortly after this photo, these fish staged an escape and found their freedom.</p>
