I"Z<p>Chris Dick was kind enough to introduce me to his friend, Dick Benson
<a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/W1QG/">W1QG</a>, a retired hardware development engineer. We went to visit his
very impressive shack (which was not difficult to spot from the
road).</p>

<p>&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>This is a high frequency (HF) software defined radio of his own
design, based on a Xilinx Spartan FPGA. For the signal processing
parts, he used Matlab and System Generator tools. It is documented
at

<p>&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>On one side he had his radio gear, together with a very substantial
collection of vintage test equipment.</p>

<p>He told me this is the best amateur receiver for its time.</p>

<p>Not everyone has a Caesium frequency standard at home (in fact
some countries donâ€™t have one). Dick
picked this up, not working, for $300 and repaired it (had a screw
loose). I later found out the original price was $32,000 which would have
been enough to buy a house at the time.</p>

<p>On the other side of the workshop was his mechanical stuff,
 including a Harley
that he restored and lots of home made  radio controlled planes.</p>

<p>This is an engine he made from scratch, using the mill in
