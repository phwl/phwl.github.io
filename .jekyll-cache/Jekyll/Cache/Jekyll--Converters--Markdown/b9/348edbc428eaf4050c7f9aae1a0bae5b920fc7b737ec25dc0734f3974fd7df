I"@<p>Warren’s brother, Derek and his son Eden were visiting from Broome
and we took them out on the Hawkesbury. We only had a few hours 
and the tides were not quite right.</p>

<p>Anyway, we started with soft plastics.  Derek got the first fish
right on cue, about 10 seconds after I announced we should catch a
fish soon. Next drift, I caught another in my first minute of fishing.</p>

<p>After making coffee we pumped some nippers.</p>

<p>In the first drift with the nippers, Eden caught his first flathead.</p>

<p>We had this double hookup of
soapy jewfish while we were drifting in front of another boat.</p>

<p>It isn’t often that everything goes according to the script,
but this was one of them!</p>
