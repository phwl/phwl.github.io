<p>Elsa Dreisig making her Covent Garden debut as Pamina was fabulous
and I was also impressed by Tuuli Takala as Queen of the Night.</p>

<p>I’ve been to London many times but never got a photo of the
skyline. Wonderful views from the top floor of Tate Modern, London.</p>

<p>This north-west view has One Blackfriers on the left, then the Blackfriers Bridge, St Paul’s Cathedral just right of center, and the chimney of the Tate Modern on the right.</p>

<p>This north-east view has St Paul’s on the left, the tallest in the middle you can see Leedenhall (Cheesgrater), The Scalpel and 20 Fenchurch St (Walkie Talkie), and on the right,
the Shard (which is the tallest building in the EU).</p>
