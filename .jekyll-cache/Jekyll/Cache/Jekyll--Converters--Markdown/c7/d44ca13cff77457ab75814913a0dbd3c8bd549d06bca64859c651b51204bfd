I"ì<p>A stapler is one of the more important pieces of academic equipement
and the best staplers were made by PaperPro.</p>

<p>Like many companies, it appears that they don‚Äôt exist any more, and
the current versions are badged under
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00149ZVTG">Bostitch</a>.  Wired
had a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/10/paperpro-makes-quite-possibly-the-best-staplers-ever/">blog
post</a>
on the PaperPro , referencing Office Supply Geek‚Äôs
<a href="http://officesupplygeek.com/desk-accessories/paper-fasteners/paperpro-staplers-quite-possibly-the-best-staplers-ever/">review</a>
(and with a name like that you would expect them to take their
staplers seriously) says it is one of the best staplers ever.</p>

<p>The reason they are good is because they employ a spring to drive the 
stapler through the paper. The earliest patent for a spring loaded
stapler appears to be
<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7681771B2">US7681771B2 Stapler</a>
which is relatively recent (2006).</p>

<p>Having a fine stapler was not sufficient though. I found that my
stapler was not up to the task of tens of sheets of paper even
though it was supposed to be able to do 25 or more. Maybe it was
the staples? At <a href="https://www.officeworks.com.au/">Officeworks</a>,
there were a number of choices, but which one? Should I purchase
the $2.78 J. Burrows Size 26/6 Staples 5000 pack, or the 5x more expensive
$2.55 Rapid 26/6 Strong Staples 1000 pack? Persuaded by the word ‚ÄúStrong‚Äù
in their product description, I purchased both.</p>
