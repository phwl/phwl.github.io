I"‹<p>Made a trip to Buckenderra Holiday Village on Lake Eucumbene for a very hot Australia Day weekend. Each day the maximum temperture was forcasted to be 32 C
and I was wearing my chest waders.</p>

<p>Didnâ€™t really have enough time to fish properly on the first evening as I 
didnâ€™t get to the water until after dark and couldnâ€™t see where to fish.
The following day we went to Jindabyne, mainly to get out of the heat.
The Red Door Roastery was very busy mid-morning.</p>

<p>The fishing was very tough and nobody that I spoke to at the caravan
park had caught anything. In the evening, fished some slightly
deeper water which I was hoping would be cooler. I was having a
quiet, contemplative time when the peace was disturbed by a fish
taking my Mrs Simpson (fly) so violently, it made me jump. The fish ran
towards me and I had to back pedal to keep the line tight.  It
tried to leap out of the water two or three times but didnâ€™t get 
airborne.  After a brief struggle I beached this fat rainbow
trout. The autopsy showed it had been feeding on stick caddis and flying
ants. I had a second hit that evening but unfortunately didnâ€™t hook up.</p>

<p>Dried the fish and covered them with salt, including the cavity. On the bottom of a foil-lined wok I added: 1/2 cup rice, 5 tablespoons of tea and 6 bay leaves.
Smoked for 30 minutes.</p>
