<p>Cicada wing. The cicadas were really noisy and like an alarm clock set for the crack of dawn. Other insect life included ticks from which I received two bites.<figure class="">

<p>These were baked in foil for dinner on the first night.</p>

<p>This trip, we had exceptional flathead fishing.</p>

<p>On the way to the boat ramp at 6am to collect Barry for a day of fishing, our outboard started playing up and we had to restart about 10 times. Fortunately, we guessed that it was due to contaminated petrol and with a new tank, we were soon on our way. Unfortunately, that day, gale force winds were in place and the fishing was quiet. Fortunately, Barry managed to get this flattie.<figure class="">

<p>Warren had the brilliant idea of putting the food in his tent so that animals wouldnâ€™t take it in the middle of the night. Something (probably a monitor lizard), made a hole in his tent and munched through half a loaf of bread. This photo shows the field repair in progress.<figure class="">

<p>Another enjoyable trip but nothing really that wasnâ€™t covered previously. Although most of our catch were flathead, we also caught bream, mulloway, catfish and a stingray.</p>

<p>Our outboard is an EvinrudeÂ E30RLETA from 1993, still works beautifully butÂ back at Warrenâ€™s place, we broke the outboardâ€™s swivel bracket - another problem to fix!</p>
