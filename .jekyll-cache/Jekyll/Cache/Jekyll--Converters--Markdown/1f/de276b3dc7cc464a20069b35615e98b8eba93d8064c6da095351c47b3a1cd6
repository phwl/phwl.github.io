<p>Our boat is now 20 years old and starting to be looking a bit old and tired (I didnâ€™t know aluminium could rust). Before we could go, we had to do a few things including installing a new sounder, filling the holes from the old one and fixing the trailer.</p>

<p>This being the Christmas period, the boat ramp was absolutely packed with people, boats and pelicans.</p>

<p>The first job was to pump saltwater pink nippers from a nearby sandflat.</p>

<p>To get to the fishing location you pass by Milsons Passage. Nice place to have a holiday house but a bit inconvenient since you can only get there by boat. At any time, about half of them are for sale.</p>

<p>Around the corner and you are in the middle of nowhere.</p>

<p>Caught a fish for dinner</p>

<p>and then we had to find a camping spot, pitch our tents and get some firewood. Had steaks and pan fried bream for dinner.</p>

<p>Got out early the following morning. For the first few hours we didnâ€™t do very well but then got into some fish. The next hour was one of those times where you catch a fish every cast.</p>

<p>I wish they wouldnâ€™t allow trawlers to fish the Hawkesbury.</p>

<p>For dinner, we had fresh fish and baked potatoes cooked on the coals.</p>

<p>That evening we had a perfectly clear night. Part of the Orion constellation appears near the bottom of the photo.</p>

<p>This was a 1 minute exposure, taken on the beach at our campsite.</p>

<p>Next day was a clear, sunny day. We knew where to go and got straight into more fish. Here is Warren hooked up.</p>

<p>Another fish</p>

<p>Our fishing spot was also the runway for float planes.</p>

<p>By mid-morning we had enough in the keeper net and decided to call it a day.</p>

<p>A crowded boat ramp at Mooney Mooney.</p>

<p>That was the end of a wonderful fishing trip. Only thing left to do was to clean the dayâ€™s catch, boat, outboard, rods, reels, cutlery, pots, â€¦</p>

<p>Bream steamed with shallots and ginger.</p>
