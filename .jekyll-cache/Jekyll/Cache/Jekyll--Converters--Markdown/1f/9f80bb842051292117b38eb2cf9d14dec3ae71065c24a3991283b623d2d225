<p>Although I always liked the design, display and speakers in an iMac,
it runs hot and noisy, and is a pain to repair. 
So when this mid-2011 iMac crossed my path, I wasn’t sure whether
it would be worth fixing, particularly since Apple
longer provides operating system updates. 
However, I had
an old 2TB Seagate Barracuda disk and it would be a shame to throw
it away.</p>

<p>iFixit has a set of instructions for replacing the hard drive (
<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iMac+Intel+27-Inch+EMC+2429+Hard+Drive+Replacement/7555">https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iMac+Intel+27-Inch+EMC+2429+Hard+Drive+Replacement/7555</a>),
but I think the sequence below is simplier.</p>

<p>The non-obvious step is opening the case. It is held in with magnets
and you need a glass lifter remove the front glass assembly. Mine was from
Harbour Freight <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/dual-cup-suction-lifter-46134.html">https://www.harborfreight.com/dual-cup-suction-lifter-46134.html</a>. Try not to touch the internal glass surfaces as you’ll have to clean 
them afterwards!</p>

<p>There are 4 screws down each vertical edge of the display assembly
(8 in total). Remove those with tweezers and a T10 Torx driver.
The display assembly fits tightly in the case. I used a right
angle pick to get under the assembly and first lift up the top left
hand side, and then the top right hand side.</p>

<p>Next remove the connector for the shortest cable so you can tilt the display.</p>

<p>Remove the the two 
T20 screws that secure the hard disk assembly to the iMac and remove
the connectors.</p>

<p>Hard disk assembly can come out now.</p>

<p>Replace the drive and put everything back together.  After I did
this, of course the display didn’t work. Had to unassemble the
machine again and play around with the display connector.</p>

<p>Next you need to download the High Sierra image (the latest version
of MacOS that supports this machine) <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT208969">https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT208969</a>
and create a bootable USB. Then boot from the USB and install to the hard disk.</p>

<p>Following that, there is an issue of fan control. It’s an easy fix if you 
are prepared to get the cable <a href="https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/DIDIMACHDD12/">https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/DIDIMACHDD12/</a>. My solution was to use this
