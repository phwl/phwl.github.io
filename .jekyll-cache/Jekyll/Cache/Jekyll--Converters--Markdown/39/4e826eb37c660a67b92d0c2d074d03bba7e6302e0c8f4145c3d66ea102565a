I"%<p>Returned to the Hawkesbury River (see <a href="http://phwl.org/?s=hawkesbury">here</a> for reports on previous trips) with Warren and my daughter Nicole. Last time I was there camping with Nicole was in 2009. The fishing was tough and the trip reasonably uneventful. Here are my snaps.</p>
