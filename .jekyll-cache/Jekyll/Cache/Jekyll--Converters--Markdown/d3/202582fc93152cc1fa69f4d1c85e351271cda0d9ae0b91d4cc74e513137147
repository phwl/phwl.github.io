<p>as a visitor at Fudan University</p>

<p>Played ping pong with students.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2012/04/P1110573.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Had a ride on the maglev to the airport. As one of the websites say, it is mainly for show since the ride is only 8 min. It is impressive though, goes up to 430 km/h, quite an experience.</p>

<p>and the Bund from above</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2012/04/P1110619.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It has a transparent floor, very unsettling to walk on</p>

<p>Cheng Huang Temple</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2012/04/P1110773.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We visited Chairman Maoâ€™s former residence in Shanghai</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2012/04/P1110832.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>He was quite a poet, as was his son.</p>

<p>Juxtaposition of old and new.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2012/04/P1110907.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>They have a wonderful canteen at Fudan. Here is part of the breakfast offering.</p>

<p>Xiao long buns.</p>

<p>Crab roe and vegetables.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2012/04/P1110683.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I saved the best for last, pig face jerky - quite a delicacy.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2012/04/P1110800.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Thanks to the hospitality of my host, Professor Wang, and his students, particularly Mr Li and Mr Chen, I had a great time in Shanghai. This is the first opportunity I have had to explore this beautiful city. I look forward to my next visit.</p>
