I"-<p>In what has turned out to become an annual event (click on <a href="http://www.phwl.org/hawkesbury-river-2011/">this link</a> for the 2011 version), went on a 4 day camping trip to the Hawkesbury River with my high-school friend, Warren. We camp on a beach which is only accessible by boat.</p>
