<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Did you worry when people (such as Linus Pauling) said your work was wrong?</em> I am my own hardest critic of my own work so I verify my work over and over to ensure it is correct.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>How do you find what to research?</em> What you should pursue comes by chance, learn lots of things, find something you are interested in and become an expert.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Did Nobel Prize change your life?</em> Nobel Prize is a license to do whatever you want and you have to choose what you want to do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>_How are things changing for the younger generation for the worse and better? _As technology develops we need people that are experts in different things e.g. nobody can make a cellphone by themselves. In the past you could only become an entrepreneur if your father owned a factory, now everybody has the opportunity.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Prof Joachim Frank</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Is it harder for researchers now than before?</em> Compared to 30 years ago researchers now have tools such as the internet for communications which allow scientific collaborations that were not feasible in the past.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>How are things changing for the younger generation for the worse and better?</em> Social media has created a dystopic environment. People need to look at their phones every 2 minutes and have serious attention deficit. Awareness has dramatically improved about world events, transcending the idea of nation states.</p>

  <li>
    <p>_Advice to a scientist embarking on their career. _If you have an idea that you have checked and believe in, don’t let someone discourage you.</p>
