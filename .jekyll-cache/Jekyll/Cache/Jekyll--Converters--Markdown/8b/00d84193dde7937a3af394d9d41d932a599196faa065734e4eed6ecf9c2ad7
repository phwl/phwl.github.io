I"e<p>Our boat was purchased around 1991 and has served us well. It is jointly owned with my close university friends, Beard and Warren. We were pleased to go out together for the first time in more than a decade. The first hour or so was disappointing, nothing much happened and I was wondering whether we were going to get skunked. However, a change of strategy brought us some luck and it turned into a great fishing day.</p>
