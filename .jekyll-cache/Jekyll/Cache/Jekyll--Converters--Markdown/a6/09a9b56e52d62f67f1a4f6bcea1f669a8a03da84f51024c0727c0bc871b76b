I"µ<p>Fished <a href="http://www.meonsprings.com">Meon Springs</a> yesterday. It was my first fishing trip in the UK and my first experience fishing a managed, stocked fishery. Went with Tero Rissa who got the beautiful 6.5 pound hen rainbow trout in the picture. A good place to take someone flyfishing for the first time but those stocked fish behave very differently to wild ones. A bit like shooting fish in a barrel though, think Iâ€™ll try <a href="http://www.gwffa-grafham.co.uk/grafham.htm">Grafham Water</a> next - at least you can see it on the map.</p>
