I"L<p>As is the custom, went for a camping/fishing trip with Warren 
on the Hawkesbury River.
Here is a list of <a href="http://phwl.org/tags/#hawkesbury">previous trips</a>.</p>

<p>The forecast was for rain so we had to pack all the normal stuff plus
firewood.</p>

<p>Right at the entrance to the expressway, I noticed that the bimini was
not right.</p>

<p>Seems like every year we bring more stuff â€¦</p>

<p>Due to bushfires, we could go last year. We came across an unexpected surprise. After years of camping here, we now need to book.</p>

<p>First cast, a school jew which was released.</p>

<p>Next, a yellowfin bream (acanthopagrus australis). They are a very slow growing
fish (see the second last figure in <a href="/assets/images/2020/12/Yellowfin-Bream.pdf">this publication</a>), so large ones should be released.</p>

<p>We were planning to make a trip back home to drop off the fish if we caught 4,
but we only got 3. Since we kept them alive in the bait tank, we only took
one and released the remaining two.</p>

<p>Used the bream gut as bait for eel fishing. We cast it out and put bells on
the rod so we could fish while cooking. After two hours, it hadnâ€™t been touched and I nearly gave up. 
Then, the bait was taken but no hookup. A few seconds after casting out
with a new bait, caught a nice pike eel.</p>

<p>It looked like it was dead so I took my pliers and was going to unhook
the eel. In a flash, it swung its head around and bit me on the thumb.</p>

<p>I was lucky to have a nice lip hook, it would have easily bit through my
6 kg monofilament trace. Anyway, I emerged as the victor!</p>

<p>To prepare steamed eel, you first cover it with salt and wash off the slime. Then
you cut it like below.</p>
