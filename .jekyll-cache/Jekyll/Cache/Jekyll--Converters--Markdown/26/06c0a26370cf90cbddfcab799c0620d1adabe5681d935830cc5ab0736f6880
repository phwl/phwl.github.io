First clean duck. We were worried it wouldnâ€™t fit in the 
wok so we cut it in half.</p>

<p>Make brine using 1 cinamon stick, bay leaves,
1/4 cup of salt and 3 star anise in a pot with 500 ml of water. Boil for 5-10 min.</p>

<p>Put duck in large pot and cover with 1500 ml of cold water. Then add the 
brine, making make sure the duck is fully submerged. 
Put pot in the fridge.</p>

<p>After 6 hours, add 600 ml of water and boil for 1 hour.
In a wok lined with foil, put 1/2 cup of rice, 4 tablespoons of tea and 6 bay leaves.</p>

<p>Wipe the duck dry. Rub Sichuan pepper powder and paprika onto the surface 
of the duck. Put on top of a stand over the steaming ingredients and use a lid
on the wok.</p>

<p>We did the rest of the cooking outside to avoid smoking our entire house. Start with a high heat and when it starts smoking, go to medium. 
Smoke for 30 minutes.</p>
