I"Å<p>This post details how to connect a Beaglebone Green (BBG) to the internet.
Actually, this should work for almost any of them.</p>

<h2 id="1-macos">1. MacOS</h2>
<p>Instructions for getting started with the BBG are available at at
at <a href="https://beagleboard.org/getting-started">https://beagleboard.org/getting-started</a>. Unfortunately, for
the latest version of MacOS (I‚Äôm using Big Sur 11.2.1), the drivers
cannot be installed. The easy way to connect is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Connect your Mac to the BBG using both the microUSB and Ethernet (you will need an Ethernet adaptor for your Mac and a cable).</li>
  <li>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">screen</code> to login to the BBG on your Mac and then type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ifconfig</code>. On my machine (the ‚Äúphwl@PHWL-MBP ~ %‚Äù prompt is for my Mac and the ‚Äúdebian@beaglebone:~$‚Äù prompt is on the BBG) it is done as follows:
``` sh
phwl@PHWL-MBP ~ % screen /dev/cu.usbmodemBBG2200804786
