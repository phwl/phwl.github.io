I"<p>I purchased a
<a href="https://www.tp-link.com/au/home-networking/powerline/tl-wpa4220/">TL-WPA4220</a>
which was
was unreliable. The connection did not stay up more than a day or so.</p>

<p>The device came with
<br />
Firmware version: 4.0.3 Build 20190326 Rel.43406 
<br />
Hardware version: TL-WPA4220 v4.0</p>

<p>After a bit of browsing I found this <a href="https://community.tp-link.com/en/home/forum/topic/78910">https://community.tp-link.com/en/home/forum/topic/78910</a>. Adding
the following script on the Ubuntu Linux machine at the other end of the powerline adaptor solved the problem
and it has been up for a week now.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>while true
do
	ping -c 1 192.168.0.1
	sleep 60
done
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Actually it still isn’t very good, stays up about a week and then needs to be powered off. I downloaded the tpPLC app for MacOS and under the advanced setting “Mode” menu, unset the “Power Saving Mode”. We’ll see if that fixes the problem.</p>

<p>I also found this link <a href="https://github.com/qca/open-plc-utils">https://github.com/qca/open-plc-utils</a> which I should explore later.</p>
