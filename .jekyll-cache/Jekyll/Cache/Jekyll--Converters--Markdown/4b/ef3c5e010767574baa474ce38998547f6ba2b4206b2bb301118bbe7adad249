I"><p>Today on the operating table we have a mid-2011 iMac with a dead hard disk.
I didnâ€™t want to repair this at first since Apple no longer supports
operating system updates, but I had an old 2TB Seagate backup disk that should
work just fine. Moreover, I always liked the beautiful industrial design
of an iMac.</p>
