<p>Traded in the Quintrex for a new <a href="http://www.stacer.com.au/Aluminium-Boat-Range1/429OutlawSideConsole?Particulars=429%20Outlaw%20Side%20Console">Stacer Outlaw 429</a> with Evinrude 50 hp at <a href="http://www.huettmarine.com.au/">Huett Marine</a>.  I highly recommend them as they are great people to deal with and very knowledgeable.</p>

<p>The other choice was a Quintrex 420SC Renegade which is nearly the same boat. One of the reasons I chose the Outlaw is it is a little deeper.</p>

<p>I really like the 3mm top and bottom aluminum,  clean layout and the side console. It is quite a bit heavier than the old boat and hence gives a much better ride in the chop. There is lots of room for storage in the front casting deck, and a live-bait tank in the rear. Will give more details of the boat as it is customised. Richard at <a href="http://www.mystaceroutlaw449.com">http://www.mystaceroutlaw449.com</a> gives good information on what he did with his Stacer Outlaw 449.</p>

<p>This is the first fish caught. Since the legal limit for mulloway has been increased to 70cm, it went back.</p>
