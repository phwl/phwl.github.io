I"Î<p>Took our 2016 Subaru Forester to Subaru for a service. They called me
back asking if I wanted to pay $143 to 
replace the Cabin Air/Pollen filter.</p>

<p>Here is the inspection report.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt even know that cars had these but since they had to take it out to
inspect it, one wouldn‚Äôt think they need to charge $100 in labour to replace.
The procedure takes about 5 min the first time. The next time it should be
about 2 min.</p>

<p>First you pull out the plastic arm that pulls up on the glovebox door.</p>

<p>Then you push the glovebox to the left to unhook the plastic hinge.</p>

<p>The glovebox comes right out and the cabin filter is on the bottom, marked ‚Äúpush‚Äù.</p>

<p>Push the tabs towards each other and slide it out.</p>

<p>Actually, the filter was not too dirty for 5 years but since I had it out, replaced it with one from Repco which was $40.85 (with NRMA discount).</p>
