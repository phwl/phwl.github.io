I"œ<p>A stapler is one of the more important pieces of academic equipement.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, the best stapler was made by PaperPro. Like
many companies,
it appears that they donâ€™t exist any more, and the current versions
are badged under <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00149ZVTG">Bostitch</a>. 
Wired had a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/10/paperpro-makes-quite-possibly-the-best-staplers-ever/">blog post</a> on the PaperPro , referencing
Office Supply Geekâ€™s <a href="http://officesupplygeek.com/desk-accessories/paper-fasteners/paperpro-staplers-quite-possibly-the-best-staplers-ever/">review</a> 
(and with a name like that you would expect them to take their staplers 
seriously) says it is one of the best staplers ever.</p>
