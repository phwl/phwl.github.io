I".<p>A few days ago I took our 2016 Subaru Forester for a service. They called me
back with the inspect report below, asking if I wanted to pay $143 for 
a replacement Cabin Air/Pollen filter.</p>

<p>I didn’t even know that cars had these but since they had to take it out to
inspect it, one wouldn’t think they need to charge $100 in labour to replace.
The procedure takes about 5 min the first time. The next time it should be
about 2 min.</p>

<p>First you pull out the plastic arm that pulls up on the glovebox door.</p>

<p>Then you push the door to the left to unhook the plastic hinge.</p>

<p>The glovebox door comes right out and the filter is the thing on the bottom with “push” on it. Push the tabs down a little and slide it out.</p>

<p>Actually, the filter was not too dirty for 5 years but since I had it out, replace it with one from Repco which was $40.85 (with NRMA discount).</p>
