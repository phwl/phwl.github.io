<p>Some sections of the Green River in Utah have 22,000 trout per mileÂ and it is arguably the best trout fishery in the US.Â When Prof Brent Nelson invited me to fish thereÂ it didnâ€™t take me long to accept.</p>

Salt Lake City (SLC) is a vast desert surrounded by the rocky mountains. At this time ofÂ year, there is still snow on most of the mountains and many higherÂ altitude lakes are still frozen. It looked vaguelyÂ familiar and I could picture John Wayne coming down the mountain.Â What I found amazing was that anyoneÂ wouldÂ settle in a place like SLC, coming over the mountains on wagonsÂ and just seeing miles and miles of featureless plains.Â They were definitely very tough people.

Upon arriving at Brent's house, we got straight into renovatingÂ his bathroom. This was necessary as they wanted to use it during myÂ visit. Academics are theorists and shouldn't be allowed to do anythingÂ too practical. Yogi Berra said, "in theory there is no differenceÂ between theory and practice, in practice there is." All of the bathroom's electrical appliances worked properly except one set of lights.Â Also earlier, a large spark was inadvertently generated due to a short.Â After much bumbling around, we isolated the problem to a loose wire deepÂ in the guts of the wiring. Quietly pleased that nobody got electrocuted,Â I helped Brent fix the rest of the bathroom, hang the door and everythingÂ was operational.

**BYU and the Trip to the Green River**

The next day, I gave a seminar at Brigham Young University (BYU). OneÂ of the best audiences I've spoken to, they asked very good questionsÂ about our work. Anyway, completed my talkÂ without embarrassing myself too much and shortly after, we embarked onÂ the 4 hour drive to the Green River.

On the way, we stopped at a 7-eleven. In the photo below, the smallÂ one on the left is a pint (600 ml) and the big one 1.9 L. I've seen 2 LÂ bottles before but never a 2 L cup. TwoÂ of those are enough to kill you.

Here are some pictures that I took on the way to the Green River.

That evening we walked the banks of the Green River. A large OspreyÂ dive-bombed a trout right in front of us. It sounded like a bomb going off.

Here is a picture of where we stayed, we don't get that much snow when weÂ go skiing.

**Green River**

Didn't sleep well that night, dreamt I lost my fishing rod.Â The next day we were at the Flaming GorgeÂ boat ramp on the Green River. The weather was far from perfect.Â It was snowing, we had a force 10 gale and it was cold enough for the line to freezeÂ in the guides. Even wearing all the clothes I brought (gloves, thermals, shirt,Â fleece and parka), I was still cold.

After a quick breakfast we met out guide, Ryan KellyÂ (www.greenriverflyfisher.com). He has the perfect life. InÂ winter he is a skiing instructor and at other times he is a fishing guide.Â Utah has great skiing and hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics. Notable resortsÂ include Sundance, Snowbird and Park City. Next time I'll try them out,Â those mountains look scary, more sheer drops than ski slopes.

We put the boat in at Flaming Gorge Dam.Â Ryan remembered Brent because his eccentricÂ brother-in-law hammered the trout using a crappie jig on a previous trip.

The river was crystal clear and we saw plenty of fish, sometimesÂ twenty at a time. Started fishing a bobber (actually, fly-fishermenÂ call them strike indicators) under which was had a sow
bug and a zebra nymph. For those non-fishermen readers, a nymph is anÂ underwater bug. Ryan made the (fishing) joke that we were nymphomanics.Â The morning started slow with the trout picking up the flies and thenÂ dropping them before.

Let me digress and discuss the mayfly which is key to trout fishing.Â It spends most of its life as a nymph on the bottom of a river. TroutÂ eat lots of them so fly-fishermen use imitations fished underneathÂ the surface of the water to catch them. When conditions are right,Â it rises to the surface and becomes a dun and then molts into a spinner.

The spinners mate, lay their eggs and die, hence the title of a book,
"Sex, death and fly fishing". All thisÂ happens within 24 hours, making it comparable to a Shakespearian tragedy.

Fly-fishermen spend lots of time waiting for conditions need to be rightÂ so the mayflies hatch in enormous numbers, causing the trout to throwÂ their natural caution to the wind and go into a feeding frenzy. In thisÂ case, called a hatch, we fish what are called dry flies on the surfaceÂ of the water, and the trout rise to take the flies.

Drifting is a beautiful way to fish as you want to present yourÂ flies so that they look like they are drifting naturally along with theÂ current. Since the boat travels roughly the same speed as theÂ flies, one can get really long drifts. After missing the firstÂ few, Brent caught the first trout and shortly after, I got this one.

![p1000320](/assets/images/2015/12/p1000320.jpg)

We caught a few more before lunch andÂ things picked up after lunch. We were soon catching a fishÂ every cast.

![p1000322](/assets/images/2015/12/p1000322.jpg)

Into the afternoon, the weather improved a little and there was a
pretty goodÂ mayfly hatch (blue winged olives or BWOs to be more precise).Â We switched to tandem dry flies, aÂ BWO and a cripple in a much large size than the natural andÂ caught a lot more fish.

Much too soon the day was over. The fishing on the Green was betterÂ than anything else I had ever experienced. One might at firstÂ think that fishing the Green would be like shooting fish in a barrel,Â but the trout are very cautious in general and require some
degree of finesse.

Ryan was a fantastic guide in all respects, a great fisherman, friendly
and willing to give advice. He would often row upstream so we could
fish the good drifts several times and always had the boat in the rightÂ position. He has the river completely wired and predicted everythingÂ that was going to happen before it actually did. His clients have neverÂ been skunked guiding on the Green, an amazing record considering theÂ wide variety of abilities with which he must have to deal. If you everÂ fish the Green, I would highly recommend him.

**Provo River**

The next morning we were to fish the Provo River which only has 3000Â fish per mile. This beautiful river is right next to Brent's house and is smaller thanÂ the Green. We were expecting it to be
a circus with lotsÂ people as it was a Saturday. It turned out that there were not veryÂ many at all but we later found that the highway leadingÂ in was closed due to a truck accident.

Again it was cold enough for our guides to ice up. We did not fish for
long before Brent lost a nice brown trout and then almostÂ immediately after caught another.

![p1000345](/assets/images/2015/12/p1000345.jpg)

Adjusting my strike indicator, I snagged the bottom. I was trying to
get it off for a while when it started to move! Fought the fish for a
while but this battle ended up in a long distance release. However, a
short time later, I caught this nice fat rainbow trout.

![p1000347](/assets/images/2015/12/p1000347.jpg)

![p1000357](/assets/images/2015/12/p1000357.jpg)

After lunch, we fished the upper Provo, expecting another mayfly hatch.Â Unfortunately, thatÂ day there were millions of people on the Upper Provo waiting for theÂ same thing and we only saw a small number of trout even we had a reallyÂ good hatch. We think the large number of people flogging the waterÂ scared the trout away.

![p1000374](/assets/images/2015/12/p1000374.jpg)

![p1000377](/assets/images/2015/12/p1000377.jpg)

On the way home, we went to Deer Creek Lake which had only recentlyÂ had ice-off (we had considered fishing Strawberry Reservoir but it wasÂ still under a few feet of ice). There were huge rainbows there thatÂ people were catching on powerbait and we saw some patrolling the edges.Â Unfortunately, they weren't too interestedÂ in the nymph I presented. I am still wondering what wouldÂ have happened if I had fished a streamer on a sinking line.

![p1000383](/assets/images/2015/12/p1000383.jpg)

That evening, I was taken kicking and screaming to a BYU ballroom
dancing concert that Brent had to attend. It was pretty good but I thinkÂ I prefer fishing.

![p1000391](/assets/images/2015/12/p1000391.jpg)

Following the concert we played pool. Wanted to play all night but weÂ were both tired.

## In Search of Coffee


The next day was a Sunday and I took a bike ride all through Utah in
search of a place to have a cup of coffee. Here are some pictures.

Couldn't find the pub though.

I had a wonderful time in Utah and look forward to returning.
John Gierach put it best, "I don't know what fly-fishing teaches
us but I think it's something we need to know."
