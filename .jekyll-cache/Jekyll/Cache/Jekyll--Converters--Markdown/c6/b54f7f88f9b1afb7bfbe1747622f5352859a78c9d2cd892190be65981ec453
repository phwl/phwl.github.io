I"´<p>Went with Beard for a day trip to Lake Wallace in the Blue Mountains.
It was a rainy day but fortunately not too windy.</p>

<p>I started spinning with a Mepps lure in the brown trout pattern.</p>

<p>The first took my lure very deep
down its mouth (and I left my pliers in the car) so decided to keep
it.<br />
The next came on the following cast, and shortly after I caught
a third, smaller one which was let go. After 15 minutes of action,
not much else happened.</p>

<p>I also had a good chat with an arborist who was locking one of the gates. He, along
with other volunteers were planting trees along the lake.</p>

<p>On the way back, took more photos of the bushfire devastation near Bell.</p>

<p>It was only the next day, while preparing the fish, that I noticed both were
tagged (sometimes, Iâ€™m not very observant). These were reported to the 
<a href="https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fishing/recreational/resources/fish-tagging/recapture-form">Department of Primary Industries Tagging Program</a>. One was 30cm and the 
other 31cm.</p>
