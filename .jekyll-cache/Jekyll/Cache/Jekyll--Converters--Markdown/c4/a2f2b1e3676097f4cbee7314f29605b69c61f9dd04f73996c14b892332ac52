<p>I hadn’t seen the devastation of the summer bushfires until now. According to <a href="https://www.bluemountains.org.au/bushfires.shtml">this</a>, “of over one million hectares (eight reserves including the Blue Mountains National Park), over 68% has been fully or partly burnt and over 122 million mammals, birds and reptiles have been impacted.”
At least things are starting to grow back.
Normally you would not be able to see through the trees because they’d have leaves.</p>
