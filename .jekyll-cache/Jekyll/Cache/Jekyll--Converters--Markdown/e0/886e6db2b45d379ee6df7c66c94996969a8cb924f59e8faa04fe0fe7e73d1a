I"´<p>The mako shark is one of the fastest and most ferocious fish in the sea. They can swim up to 69 km/h (42 mph) and jump 6m (20 feet) in the air. There two species, the shortfin (<em>Isurus oxyrinchus</em>) and the longfin (_Isurus paucus), _the shortfin being more common. San Diego is the best place to fish for them, and so following the <a href="https://www.fccm.org/">FCCM Conference</a>, Ken and I went to fly-fish for them.</p>
