I"3<p>After attending the <a href="http://fpt.massey.ac.nz/">International Conference on Field Programmable Technology</a>, Brent, Ken and myself took a 5-day fly-fishing trip around the Omarama region of the South Island in New Zealand. We called this the 1st FPGA Fly-Fishing Symposium (FFFâ€™15). Last time I was there was <a href="http://phwl.org/1996/new-zealand-trip/">Nov 1996</a>, before web browers and digital cameras! I had previously fished with Brent in <a href="http://phwl.org/2015/fishing-renovating-and-ballroom-dancing-in-utah-2008/">Utah</a>.</p>
