I"@	<p>This post details how to get started with a BeagleBone Green (BBG) microSD card.</p>

<h2 id="1-getting-started">1. Getting Started</h2>
<p>Instructions for getting started with the BBG are available at at 
at <a href="https://beagleboard.org/getting-started">https://beagleboard.org/getting-started</a>. This involves downloading

<p>The driver for networking via USB didn’t work with the latest version

password for user “debian”)</p>
