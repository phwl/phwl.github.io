I"Y<p>It started off as a rather routine Easter fishing day trip to Mooney Mooney with
Warren.</p>

<p>It was a very foggy morning, worse than I’ve ever seen it on the Hawkesbury.
Near the boat ramp, a sign said that it was closed. Made a detour to Brooklyn 
and launched there. That put us about an hour behind.</p>

<p>On one of the camping islands, I saw the odd scene below of a really large tent and
a small kayak. We chatted with the guy for about 10 minutes before he casually requested that we rescue them as their inflatable boat disappeared in the middle of the night.
Since the outboard was still at the campsite, we thought it was very unlikely it had
been stolen. They had just pull it up high onto the shore. 
They had called 000 who weren’t interested in rescuing them. It was also
a shame that my VHF marine radio was out of service with a dead battery so I couldn’t
use it to call Marine Rescue.  We said we would go fishing and come back for them.</p>

<p>The fishing was a bit tough but we got a nice bream as we were changing spots.</p>

<p>It became a nice day as the fog cleared.</p>

<p>After fishing for a couple of hours, I called them and said we would be there in 20
min. During the call, I hooked a nice flathead but it broke the line about a meter
from the boat. That’s the second consecutive flathead I’ve lost right near the boat.</p>

<p>When we arrived, Dong and Lin had packed everything in the kayak. Warren and I were
a bit worried about all the stuff in it, including an outboard.</p>

<p>Anyway, Dong said not to worry so off we went.</p>

<p>Another boat created a large wake and we carefully negotiated it. We were just 
starting to get confident when the kayak flipped over.</p>
