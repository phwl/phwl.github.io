I"Á<p>I was having problems charging my <a href="/2019/death-of-a-canon-s120/">Canon G9x</a> 
via USB.</p>

<p>A Google search shows that Iâ€™m not the only one, e.g.

<p>The symptoms were that when I plugged in the camera, it would 
come up in Play mode and the charging light never comes on.
Checking the current, it was 0.06 and clearly not charging.</p>

<p>Switching the camera off didnâ€™t help.</p>

<p>I then used the same cable to charge an Android phone and it worked.</p>

<p>I tried a different cable which worked. The camera started charging 
with 0.39A and the orange charging light came one.</p>

<p>A different cable also worked.</p>

<p>I also tried an Apple 5W iphone charger which outputs a maximum of 1A (the 
one previously could output 4.8A. That worked as well.</p>

<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I think that cases where the G9x doesnâ€™t charge via USB are due to the cable,
not the charger or anything else.</li>
  <li>The cable that couldnâ€™t charge the G9x was not faulty so it must be
something else.</li>
</ul>
