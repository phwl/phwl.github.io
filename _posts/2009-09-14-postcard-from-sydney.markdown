Having been educated in Sydney, I was surprised that moving back would be a culture shock. I can translate "Bloody oath it's a sheila" to "What a surprise, here is a member of the fairer sex," and know that a "googly" has no relation to Google, but can't say I've adjusted yet after having spent 12 years in Hong Kong.

It would take about a week to travel from the airport to my home by public transport so the first task at hand was to buy a second hand car. Pickles Auctions sells hundreds of ex-fleet and ex-government cars and about 20 minutes from entering the premises I was the owner of a 2006 VZ Holden Commodore - I've spent more time choosing a book. The Commodore is the quintessential Australian touring car and is as Aussie as cappuccino. With its 3.6 litre V6, it tows a boat as if it wasn't there. I think it was a good deal because 5 minutes after paying for the car an Indian guy offered to buy it from me at a higher price. I look forward to this car being the basis for many adventures ahead.

We live in a cul-de-sac and have already met most of our neighbours. We knew one of them earlier because they rented our house before they bought the one next door. The gentleman across the road is like the mayor of the street and has been living there for 45 years. They are very friendly and keep an eye out on all happenings. My best friend lives nearby and it is great to see our kids play together as we used to when we were their age.

The first day we went to see our place I found a blue tongue lizard more than a foot long. P was so freaked I didn't even threaten to leave it on her pillow.

There is a Chinese supermarket nearby with all kinds of groceries including "ma la" oil, "lao gan ma" chili sauce and other essentials. Whereas before, most Chinese people were from Hong Kong, now the majority are from the mainland and one can get around only speaking putonghua.

I have told many of you that I came to HK with two suitcases and left with a full container. The picture below shows I was not exaggerating. In Hong Kong, 9 people helped to pack our stuff whereas in Australia they just sent two big blokes. They hardly broke a sweat even with the piano. Everything was sorted out in about 3 hours.

In the afternoon many different types of birds come to visit. I haven't really had time to really watch them carefully but I've spotted many different species including cockatoos, magpies, kookaburras and rainbow lorikeets. My favourites are the kookaburras which make a long laughing sound. In the photo below, sulphur crested cockatoos are flying overhead.

Our garden has more weeds than grass at the moment. I tried pulling them out but the roots are so long and deep it was impossible to do without breaking them. I've resorted to weed killer, hope it works. We've also planted some basil, tomatoes, rosemary and rocket. Also plan to get a lemon or lime tree at some stage. My friend Warren told me that "lemonade trees" are available which have lemons, limes and oranges grafted on the same tree.

Anyway, with all the house-related work I've been so busy we haven't even gone fishing yet. Renovating is definitely going to take a long time. Parts of it are falling apart and will need to be taken down.
