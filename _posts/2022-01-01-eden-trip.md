This was planned as a family trip but Nicole was a COVID close contact 
the day prior to departure so couldn't participate.

Eden is on the New South Wales Sapphire Coast and it is easy to see how it got its name.

Had oysters at Merimbula Gormet Oysters. It is right on the oyster farm and they are very fresh but not much else to eat there.

You can see the oyster racks in the background.

[Wheelers Seafood Restaurant](https://www.wheelersoysters.com.au/) in Pambula is much better. The fried scallops were excellent.

This is the Nullica River near the mouth.

On New Years Eve, we went to Merimbula.

Went to Quarantine Bay which is appropriately named for the COVID-19 pandemic.

Tested our new [Terravent Kayak](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Dropshipping-Terravent-3M-Cheap-Foldable-Canoe_1600341317061.html).
It fits easily in the rear footwell of our car and this photo shows
the entire package, with 4 piece oars and life jacket in the dry bag.

Kayak is pretty stable and no complaints about the speed.

On this maiden trip, I managed to break this plastic clips. Thankfully it comes with a spare so I was able to make a full repair.

This bungy cord for the foot rest came off the hook but didn't break.
