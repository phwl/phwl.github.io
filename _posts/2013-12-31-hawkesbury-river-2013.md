Our trips to the Hawkesbury River have become an annual event ([2012](http://www.phwl.org/hawkesbury-river-2012-2/), [2011](http://www.phwl.org/hawkesbury-river-2011/)).

As usual, the boat ramp was at capacity.

Went overboard with supplies, not much room for the passengers.

Bandicoot hole, we saw it after dark but didn't get a photograph.![](/assets/images/2013/12/PC2843781.jpg){: .align-center}

Cicada wing. The cicadas were really noisy and like an alarm clock set for the crack of dawn. Other insect life included ticks from which I received two bites.![](/assets/images/2013/12/PC2843941.jpg){: .align-center}

These were baked in foil for dinner on the first night.

This trip, we had exceptional flathead fishing.

The biggest was around 50 cm.![](/assets/images/2013/12/PC2844131.jpg){: .align-center}

Mulloway just short of the 45 cm minimum.

On the way to the boat ramp at 6am to collect Barry for a day of fishing, our outboard started playing up and we had to restart about 10 times. Fortunately, we guessed that it was due to contaminated petrol and with a new tank, we were soon on our way. Unfortunately, that day, gale force winds were in place and the fishing was quiet. Fortunately, Barry managed to get this flattie.![](/assets/images/2013/12/PC294417.jpg){: .align-center}

Warren had the brilliant idea of putting the food in his tent so that animals wouldn't take it in the middle of the night. Something (probably a monitor lizard), made a hole in his tent and munched through half a loaf of bread. This photo shows the field repair in progress.![](/assets/images/2013/12/PC294423.jpg){: .align-center}

Another enjoyable trip but nothing really that wasn't covered previously. Although most of our catch were flathead, we also caught bream, mulloway, catfish and a stingray.

Our outboard is an Evinrude E30RLETA from 1993, still works beautifully but back at Warren's place, we broke the outboard's swivel bracket - another problem to fix!
