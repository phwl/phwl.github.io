Went to the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden to see the David McVicar
production of The Magic Flute.

Elsa Dreisig making her Covent Garden debut as Pamina was fabulous
and I was also impressed by Tuuli Takala as Queen of the Night.

I've been to London many times but never got a photo of the
skyline. Wonderful views from the top floor of Tate Modern, London.

This Great Dane is a regular at the MK Restaurant on Gloucester Rd in 
South Kensington.
