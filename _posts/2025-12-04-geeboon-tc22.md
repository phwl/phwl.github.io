Decided it was time to retire my Weller WS50 which has been with me since I was an undergraduate (I've still got an older working Magnastat Weller from high school).

I replaced it with a [Geeboon TC22](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006397758007.html). The package that I purchased included the SDC02 stand which will put the iron in sleep mode when the handle is in the holder. Unfortunately, I got this message.

So the first repair with my new TC22 soldering iron was to fix its stand. 
Here's the internals of the SDC02 stand. It's 3D printed and pretty simple.

Since there were only 3 wires going from the handle to the station, it didn't take long to work out that the white wire should be connected to the pin shown with the red arrow.

Everything working!

Geeboon was very apologetic and offered to send me a free tip for my trouble. Overall, I received great service from them.
