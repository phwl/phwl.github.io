I purchased a
[TL-WPA4220](https://www.tp-link.com/au/home-networking/powerline/tl-wpa4220/)
which was
was unreliable. The connection did not stay up more than a day or so.

<!-- more -->

The device came with
<br>
Firmware version: 4.0.3 Build 20190326 Rel.43406 
<br>
Hardware version: TL-WPA4220 v4.0

After a bit of browsing I found this <https://community.tp-link.com/en/home/forum/topic/78910>. Adding
the following script on the Ubuntu Linux machine at the other end of the powerline adaptor solved the problem
and it has been up for a week now.

```
while true
do
	ping -c 1 192.168.0.1
	sleep 60
done
```

Actually it still isn't very good, stays up about a week and then needs to be powered off. I downloaded the tpPLC app for MacOS and under the advanced setting "Mode" menu, unset the "Power Saving Mode". We'll see if that fixes the problem.

I also found this link <https://github.com/qca/open-plc-utils> which I should explore later.
