I purchased a
[TL-WPA4220](https://www.tp-link.com/au/home-networking/powerline/tl-wpa4220/)
which turns out to be unreliable, with the connection not staying up more than
a day or so.

Firmware version: 4.0.3 Build 20190326 Rel.43406 
<br>
Hardware version: TL-WPA4220 v4.0

After a bit of browsing I found this <https://community.tp-link.com/en/home/forum/topic/78910>. After adding
a script on the other end of the powerline adaptor

```
while true
do
	date
	ping -c 1 192.168.0.1
	sleep 60
done
```
the problem has gone away.
