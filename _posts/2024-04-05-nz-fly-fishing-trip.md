Over the Easter break, went on a fly-fishing trip to the South Island of 
New Zealand with Beard.

Petrol was amazingly expensive with the exchange rate being, NZD 1=AUD 0.918.

There was significant controversy when Tip Top [discontinued Goody Goody Gum Drops ice cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goody_Goody_Gum_Drops). Fortunately it is now back.

My first trout of the trip caught on a #10 brown Hares Ear. A rainbow in very poor condition.

At least it was better than Beard's first fish!

We started catching better fish. In our best session, the trout went carzy and we caught five around 4 lbs in half an hour.

Anyway, no problem I kept fishing. A fat rainbow trout.
