Over the Easter break, went on a fly-fishing trip to the South Island of 
New Zealand with Beard. [My last trip was in 2015]({% link _posts/2015-12-15-new-zealand-fly-fishing-2015.md %}),


## Trip Report
Petrol was amazingly expensive with the exchange rate being NZD 1=AUD 0.918.

Beard managed to puncture his new waders on the first day. Amazingly, after an unsucessful attempt using Gorilla tape, he patched them with bandaids and contact adhesive. They were fine for the rest of the trip.

I managed to sit on my glasses on the second day. Luckily I had a spare pair.

There was significant controversy when Tip Top [discontinued Goody Goody Gum Drops ice cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goody_Goody_Gum_Drops). Fortunately it is now back.

## Fishing
I didnâ€™t catch any fish on the first day but when I switched back to my normal fishing hat the following day, I started catching. Coincidence? I think not. As my friend Ebbtide said, "Always risky wearing a new/different hat fishing."

My first fish. It's a rainbow trout in poor condition.

At least it was better than Beard's first fish!

An autopsy revealed a few nymphs.

We started catching better fish. In our best session, the trout went carzy and we caught five around 4 lbs in half an hour.

Here is a video that Beard took of me landing a brown.

Another video, this time Beard landing a rainbow.

This last brown trout was 4.5 lbs.

Next day Beard was unwell, I think he caught the flu. 
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/04/IMG_5996.jpeg" caption="" %}

Anyway, no problem I kept fishing. A fat rainbow trout.

Here's a brown. Can't remember if it was this one but I caught one on the very last cast of a session.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/04/IMG_6119.jpeg" caption="" %}

A very chewed up brown Hares Ear nymph. I made 6 dozen flies for the trip but all my fish were caught on these and I lost about 10 of them.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/04/IMG_6121.jpeg" caption="" %}

We released most of the fish.
