This is a trip report from the [NANDA workshop](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/hipeds-centre/workshops/nanda-2023/) in London.

Took CX100 to Hong Kong and didn't get to my hotel until close to midnight HK time (which was 2am
Sydney time). However, they must have filled the hotel because I was upgraded to a suite.

The following day the first stop was the table tennis shop for new
rubber. Apparently it should be changed every year. It was more
than 10 years since I changed mine and I was told off by the cranky
uncle there because the rubber had perished and the glue stuck to
the blade. He told me I needed a new blade (and it shouldn't be a Stiga)
so I did as he said.
I very much miss HK, overseas most shop owners don't
verbally abuse their customers. He wasn't happy when I asked for orange balls 
(they stopped using them a few years ago).

It was a pretty impressive shop. A Japanese customer came in and I helped translate. 
After that the owner was all smiles.

Photos of lots of champions including Soo Wai-yam, Ma Lin and Tomokazu Harimoto.

After a few meetings at CUHK, went to play with the table tennis team. I hadn't seen Mr Ho
(in blue) for more than 10 years and he reminded us
that we had won the HK University competition many years ago.

When I got back to my hotel, there was already a red rainstorm warning in effect. This
soon became a black rainstorm warning which shut the city down and I had to cancel my visit
to HKU.
According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/hong-kongs-heaviest-rain-least-140-years-floods-city-streets-metro-2023-09-08/), it was the heaviest rainfall on record, HK receiving 20cm in a few hours. This
guy was cleaning the drain.

Fortunately, there were still a few restaurants open in Tsim Sha Tsui.

Later that evening, when the warning signal was removed, I  went for roast goose here. The
owner still remembers me.

Then had a pleasant evening listing to jazz at Ned Kelly's Last Stand.

The main event was the [NANDA Workshop](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/hipeds-centre/workshops/nanda-2023/), hosted by Prof Wayne Luk.
It was great to catch up with some old friends including Ruby Lee from Princeton. The workshop
was truly excellent with  papers on computer architecture, design automation and reconfigurable computing.

The next day I did a viva-voce examination for Prof Christos-Savvas Bouganis at
Imperial College (congratulations to Dr Diederik Vink). Our exam only went for about 3 hours (they have been known to
take the whole day) so we had time for lunch at the Imperial staff restaurant. Here I am with
Christos and Prof Peter Cheung.

It was a great trip and I'd like to thank Prof Wayne Luk for his hospitality.
