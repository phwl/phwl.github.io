<p>Hosted by Prof Hiroki Nakahara and Prof Yuko Hara-Azumi, I gave a talk entitled “Large Scale FPGA Implementations of Machine Learning Algorithms” (slides available at <a href="http://phwl.org/talks">phwl.org/talks</a>) at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. The highlight was a visit to the Tsubame 3.0 supercomputer. In the photo below, from left to right, myself, Prof Yuko Hara-Azumi (Tokyo Tech), Prof Nachiket Kapre (Waterloo) and Prof Hiroki Nakahara (Tokyo Tech).</p>

<p>The machine was ranked first in the <a href="https://www.top500.org/green500/">Green 500</a> List (June 2017), in which it achieved 14.1 GFlops/Watt Linpack efficiency, and 13nd in the <a href="https://www.top500.org">Top 500</a> (November 2017). It has 36,288 cores and has a Linpack performance of 1998 TFlop/s, drawing a remarkable 142 kW.</p>
