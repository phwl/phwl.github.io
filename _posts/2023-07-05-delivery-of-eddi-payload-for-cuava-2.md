The Electron Density and Debris Instrument (EDDI) that I've been working on with Quinn Musulin, Iver Cairns and Joe Khachan was delivered. The instrument measures electric field spectrum using a dipole antenna. More details on the [CUAVA-site](https://www.cuava.com.au/delivery-of-eddi-payload-for-cuava-2/).
