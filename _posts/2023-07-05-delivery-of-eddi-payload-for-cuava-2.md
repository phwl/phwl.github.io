The Electron Density and Debris Instrument (EDDI) that I've been working on with Quinn Musulin, Iver Cairns and Joe Khachan was delivered. The instrument measures electric field spectrum using a dipole antenna. More details on the [CUAVA-site](https://www.cuava.com.au/delivery-of-eddi-payload-for-cuava-2/).

Update 16/5/2024: The launch is 1818 UTC on the 1/7/2024 (0418 Sydney time on 2/7/2024).
