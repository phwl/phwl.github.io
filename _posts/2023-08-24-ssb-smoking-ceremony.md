After many years of planning, the Shepherd St Building construction at the
[University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/) is commencing. Here are some photos from the [Smoking
Ceremony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_ceremony) to ward off bad
spirits. Here are some photos including the Deputy Dean Prof Hesham El Gammal, Tony Sukkar Managing Director Buildcorp
and the Vice Chancellor, Prof Mark Scott.
