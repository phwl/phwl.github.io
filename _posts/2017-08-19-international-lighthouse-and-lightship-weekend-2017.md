At my first [International Lighthouse and Lightship Weekend](https://illw.net/) with the [Manly Warringah Radio Society](http://www.mwrs.org.au/), operating from Barrenjoey Lighthouse. Here is their writeup: [http://www.mwrs.org.au/lighthouse-operations/](http://www.mwrs.org.au/lighthouse-operations/). It was a great experience to stay there for the night.
