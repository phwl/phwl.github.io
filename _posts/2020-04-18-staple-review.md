A stapler is one of the more important pieces of academic equipment.

## Background
PaperPro make excellent staplers but it appears they don't exist any more, 
current versions being badged under
[Bostitch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00149ZVTG).  Wired
had a [blog
post](https://www.wired.com/2010/10/paperpro-makes-quite-possibly-the-best-staplers-ever/)
on the PaperPro , referencing Office Supply Geek's
[review](http://officesupplygeek.com/desk-accessories/paper-fasteners/paperpro-staplers-quite-possibly-the-best-staplers-ever/)
(and with a name like that you would expect them to take their
staplers seriously) says it is one of the best staplers ever.

The reason they are good is because they employ a spring to drive the 
stapler through the paper. The earliest patent for a spring loaded
stapler appears to be
[US7681771B2 Stapler](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7681771B2)
which is relatively recent (2006).


## Three brands of staples
Having a fine stapler is not sufficient. My
stapler was not up to the task of tens of sheets of paper even
though it was supposed to be able to do 25 or more. Maybe it was
the Celco staples I was using? At [Officeworks](https://www.officeworks.com.au/),
there were a number of choices, but which one? Should I purchase
the $2.78 "J. Burrows Size 26/6 Staples 5000 pack", or the 5x more expensive
$2.55 "Rapid 26/6 Strong Staples 1000 pack"? I purchased both to compare.

Staples are often described as X/Y type, with X being the gauge and
Y being the length of the leg. Thus 26/6 means that the diameter is
26 AWG (0.405 mm) and the leg is 6 mm.
Having three different types of staples, I first verified their diameter.
All three were fine.

So how well do they work? I took a 50 page (25 sheet) draft paper that
we are working on and tried all three. In all the figures below, we have
the J. Burrows (left), Celco (middle) and Rapid (right) staples. All
three are made in China.

Clearly the middle Celco, which were the original ones that I wasn't
happy with, were not up to the task. The Rapid is also
slightly higher than the Burrows.

It is even more apparent from the bottom. The best is the Burrows,
next is the Rapid (they managed to fool by using "Strong" in
their product name) and last was Celco.
