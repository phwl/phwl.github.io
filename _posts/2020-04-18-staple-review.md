A stapler is one of the more important pieces of academic equipment.

## Background
PaperPro made excellent staplers but it appears the company doesn't exist any more and 
current versions are badged under
[Bostitch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00149ZVTG).  Wired
had a [blog
post](https://www.wired.com/2010/10/paperpro-makes-quite-possibly-the-best-staplers-ever/)
on the PaperPro , referencing Office Supply Geek's
[review](http://officesupplygeek.com/desk-accessories/paper-fasteners/paperpro-staplers-quite-possibly-the-best-staplers-ever/)
(and with a name like that you would expect them to take their
staplers seriously). They say it is one of the best staplers ever.

The reason they are good is because they employ a spring to drive the 
staple through the paper. The earliest patent for a spring loaded
stapler appears to be
[US7681771B2 Stapler](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7681771B2),
which is relatively recent (2006).


## Three brands of staples
Having a fine stapler is not enough. My
stapler could not even go through tens of sheets of paper, even
though it's supposed to do 25. Was it
the Celco staples I was using? 

At [Officeworks](https://www.officeworks.com.au/),
there are a number of choices, but which one? Should I get
the $2.78 "J. Burrows Size 26/6 Staples 5000 pack", or the 5x more expensive
$2.55 "Rapid 26/6 Strong Staples 1000 pack"? I bought both to compare.

Staples are specified as X/Y type, with X being the gauge and
Y being the length of the leg. The 26/6 size is the most common,
and this means that the diameter
is 26 AWG (0.405 mm) and the leg is 6 mm (note that the diameter
gets bigger as the gauge gets smaller).  I first 
verified the diameter of my three types of staples.  All were fine.

So how well did they work? I took a 50 page (25 sheet) draft paper that
we are working on and tried all three. In all the figures below, we have
the J. Burrows (left), Celco (middle) and Rapid (right) staples. All
three are made in China.

Clearly the middle Celco (the original ones I wasn't
happy with) were not up to the task. The Rapid not punched in as far
as the Burrows.

The difference was even more apparent from the bottom. The best is the Burrows,
next the Rapid (they managed to fool me by using "Strong" in
the name) and last was the Celco brand.
