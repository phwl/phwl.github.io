Had a short holiday prior to giving my [2018 Reconfigurable Computing course](http://phwl.org/harbin-intitute-of-technology-reconfigurable-computing-course-2018/) at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT). Photos herein are mainly of food.

This is the street scene just outside the gates of HIT.

I happened to be there at the same time as the Shanghai Photofair, which was at the Shanghai Exhibition Center. I've never seen so many people carrying fancy cameras in the one place.
