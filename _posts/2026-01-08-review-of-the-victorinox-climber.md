The medium-sized [Victorinox Climber](https://www.victorinox.com/en/Products/Swiss-Army-Knife%E2%84%A2-and-Tools/Essentials/Climber/p/1.3703) is my favourite Swiss Army Knife (SAK)
and I've carried one for fishing, camping and fixing things for several decades.

All Victorinox pocket knives that I have purchased have been of
admirable quality with absolutely no play, snappy closing and a
flawless finish.  The steel is easy to sharpen and virtually
rustproof.  Although I managed to crack them by dropping on the
ground, the scales really stand up to hard usage.  The
[SAKwiki](https://sakwiki.com) has a good page on all the different
[Climber models](https://sakwiki.com/tiki-index.php?page=Climber)
and history.

## Standard (1.3703 model)

{% include figure image_path="https://imageengine.victorinox.com/transform/b930a3ee-e28e-40e8-bb94-6f4dbc02bddf/SAK_1_3703__S1-tif?io=transform%3Afit%2Cwidth%3A600%2Cheight%3A360&quality=100" %}

The standard Climber is a three-layer SAK and has the following dimensions:
* Width: 26 mm
* Height: 18 mm
* Length: 91 mm and
* Weight: 82 g.  

It is equipped with the following tools: 
1. Blade, large
1. Blade, small
1. Corkscrew
1. Can opener and Screwdriver 3 mm
1. Bottle opener and Screwdriver 6 mm
1. Wire stripper
1. Reamer, punch and sewing awl
1. Scissors
1. Multipurpose hook
1. Key ring
1. Tweezers
1. Toothpick.

My current Climber was purchased at the Lausanne Victorinox store in 2023 (see <https://phwl.org/2023/a-visit-to-the-victorinox-store-lausanne/>). It has the "Plus" scales which include an extra slot for a pen. 
Not everyone knows that there is a hole for a pin under the corkscrew in
all modern scales.

I use the large blade for food preparation and the small blade for other work such as opening boxes, cutting plastic etc. The scissors are often used for controlled cuts, particularly to trim fishing knots (and added bonus is that one is less likely to stab oneself when doing this on a rocking boat). I also like having the separate can and bottle openers because the can opener works very well as a Philips screwdriver. The bottle opener is often used as a flat blade screwdriver and for prying. I have added a mini screwdriver on the corkscrew and the awl gets occasional use. Even the toothpick and tweezers get used from time to time, the former being excellent for cleaning USB ports.

### Compared with Other Models

Others may prefer the 2-layer [Compact](https://www.victorinox.com/en/Products/Swiss-Army-Knife%E2%84%A2-and-Tools/Essentials/Compact/p/1.3405) (left) or 3-layer [Companion](https://www.victorinox.com/en/Products/Swiss-Army-Knife%E2%84%A2-and-Tools/Essentials/Companion/p/1.3909) (middle), the usefulness of having 2 blades and the choice of two screwdrivers better suit my purposes.
The [Super Tinker](https://www.victorinox.com/en/Products/Swiss-Army-Knife%E2%84%A2-and-Tools/Essentials/Super-Tinker/p/1.4703) (right) replaces the corkscrew in a Climber with a Philips screwdriver. Unfortunately, one loses the mini screwdriver which has come in handy to fix glasses (mine and others) from time to time. Moreover, it can't be used to open a bottle of wine in an emergency!
## Long Nail File Version (1.3722 model)

A less common variant is the 1.3722 Climber which replaces the
parcel hook with a long nail file. Furthermore, it has no keyring
(this probably being because it was derived from an earlier model,
the Traveller).  I believe the nail file is a more useful tool than
the parcel hook as apart from filing things, it is useful for making
notches and prodding things in confined spaces as is often required in dealing
with electronics.

Finally, the Pioneer X Alox is also very similar. It does not have the cellidor (plastic scales) and hence you lose the small blade, corkscrew, hook, toothpick, tweezers and pin. However, it is considerably thinner and the awl is handy. I also like this model.
