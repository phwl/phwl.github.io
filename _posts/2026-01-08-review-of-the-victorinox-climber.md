The [91mm Victorinox Climber](https://www.victorinox.com/en/Products/Swiss-Army-Knife%E2%84%A2-and-Tools/Essentials/Climber/p/1.3703) is my favourite Swiss Army Knife (SAK)
and has been my companion for many decades.

All Victorinox pocket knives that I have purchased have been of
admirable quality with absolutely no play, snappy closing and a
flawless finish.  The steel is easy to sharpen and virtually
rustproof.  Although I managed to crack them by dropping on the
ground, the scales really stand up to hard usage.  The
[SAKwiki](https://sakwiki.com) has a good page on all the different
[Climber models](https://sakwiki.com/tiki-index.php?page=Climber)
and history.

## Standard (1.3703 model)

The current one I am using was purchased at the Lausanne Victorinox store in 2023 (see <https://phwl.org/2023/a-visit-to-the-victorinox-store-lausanne/>). It has the "Plus" scales which include an extra slot for a pen. 
Not everyone knows that there is a hole for a pin under the corkscrew in
all modern scales.

The standard Climber is a three-layer SAK and has the following dimensions:
* Width: 26 mm
* Height: 18 mm
* Length: 91 mm and
* Weight: 82 g.  

It is equipped with the following tools: 
1. Blade, large
1. Blade, small
1. Corkscrew
1. Can opener and Screwdriver 3 mm
1. Bottle opener and Screwdriver 6 mm
1. Wire stripper
1. Reamer, punch and sewing awl
1. Scissors
1. Multipurpose hook
1. Key ring
1. Tweezers
1. Toothpick.

I use the large blade for food preparation and the small blade for other work such as opening boxes, cutting plastic etc. The scissors are often used for controlled cuts, particularly to trim fishing knots (and added bonus is that one is less likely to stab oneself when doing this on a rocking boat). I also like having the separate can and bottle openers because the can opener works very well as a Philips screwdriver. The bottle opener is often used as a flat blade screwdriver and for prying. I have added a mini screwdriver on the corkscrew and the awl gets occasional use. Even the toothpick and tweezers get used from time to time, the former being excellent for cleaning USB ports.

Other people may prefer the 2-layer [Compact](https://www.victorinox.com/en/Products/Swiss-Army-Knife%E2%84%A2-and-Tools/Essentials/Compact/p/1.3405) or 3-layer [Companion](https://www.victorinox.com/en/Products/Swiss-Army-Knife%E2%84%A2-and-Tools/Essentials/Companion/p/1.3909), the usefulness of having 2 blades and the choice of two screwdrivers better suit my purposes.

## Long Nail File Version (1.3722 model)

I've found all the tools on the standard Climber useful except the parcel hook. 
The 1.3722 replaces the parcel hook with a long nail file. Moreover,
it has no keyring, this probably being because it was derived from
an earlier model, the Traveller, which also didn't have a keyring.
Mine was ordered many years ago from <https://www.swiss-knife.com/en/>.
This version is not nearly as common but I believe the nail file
is a more useful tool.  Apart from filing things, it is useful for
making notches and prodding things in confined spaces.
