In this summer of fishing, went to Pittwater with Beard and Carol (my student).

This is us heading out in the morning from Rowland Reserve. It was nice and overcast in the morning.

The morning was
pretty quiet with the only action being my losing a flathead right by the boat.
We met up with Dr Phil for an early lunch.

Things picked up a bit after the low tide. We caught a pike and flathead. Then this tailor. 

Prior to the trip, I told Carol that if she hooked a kingfish, she would need to be assertive or else it would cut her off. A kingfish took my soft plastic and cut me off. Even though I locked up the drag during the fight, it only took about 5 seconds for the fish to gain its freedom (5kg line wasn't a great idea).

This is still the holiday period. So many boats out there, even on a weekday!

Three dinners. Which do you prefer?

P's cooking not mine. With perfect timing, we ran out of gas and had to move indoors.
