## Shenzhen
I always look forward to visiting Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Here are some photos from the trip.

Following my lecture on a Monday, I took the late night flight to
Hong Kong.  Arrived at 5am and went straight to
[CTAccel](http://www.ct-accel.com/home-page/) in Shenzhen, founded by two of
my ex-students, Haile Yu and Jackson Yeung. Shenzhen is an amazing
city which only started being developed in the 1980s. This is the
view from CTAccel.

In the afternoon, Haile, Jackson and myself went to visit
[Corerain](http://corerain.com), founded by my collaborators,
Prof Wayne Luk of Imperial College, Dr Xinyu Niu and 
ex-student Dr Kuen Hung Tsoi.

## HKU and Movertical

The next stop was Hong Kong University (HKU) to visit A/Prof Hayden
So. He had arranged an excursion with his colleagues to Movertical,
an urban farm based on stackable containers. It is a laboratory
environment for testing ideas in sustainable farming and we were
asked for suggestions to better automate the farm.

I was there to see if we can help monitor fish behaviour
using machine learning.

Also listened to jazz at Ned Kelly's Last Stand. I always have an enjoyable time there.

## Fudan University, Shanghai
Next stop was Fudan University. Due to the protests in Hong Kong, there
was tight security at the airport.
