Went to Tasmania for a few days. Last time I was here was
[2015](/2015/tasmanian-holiday-2015/).

Sydney airport Terminal 2 wasn't exactly busy.

Flew into Launceston and
hired a campervan from [Autorent Hertz](https://www.hertz.com.au/p/hire-a-car/australia/tasmania/launceston/launceston-downtown) in Launceston.

We settled in the Caravan Park at Devonport and drove out to [Hursey Seafoods in Stanley](https://www.hurseyseafoods.com.au/). The food there was ok but overrated if you ask me. I had flake and chips.

These photos were taken around the lighthouse at Devonport.

We swapped the campervan for a hire car and drove to Hobart. This is
the ginseng and salmon farm at [41 south](https://www.41southtasmania.com/).
Highly recommend their hot smoked salmon.

In Hobart we stayed at the [St Ives Apartments](https://www.stivesmotel.com.au/) which is very well located and a short walk to Constitution Dock. I went for an evening walk and came across this Aussie nativity scene.

Best meal of the trip was a [Blue Eye Seafood](https://www.blueeye.net.au/menus/) in Hobart. We got there at noon before it was packed.

Land here is much cheaper than Sydney.
