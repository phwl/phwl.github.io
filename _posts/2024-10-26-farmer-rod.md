## Farm Tour

We first went for a tour of the farm in Rod's buggy.

## Fixing Forklift

The first job was to repair this Ursus forklift, the linkage to the chain was
broken so we fabricated a piece of steel as a substitute (actually Rod fabricated, I held the torch).

## Massey Ferguson Fuel Separator

Spent a while looking for a plastic piece of the fuel separator that disappeared. Couldn't find it so, as Rod puts it, we applied a country-boy fix. A piece of aluminium tube and washer was used as a substitute.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8322.jpeg" caption="" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8328.jpeg" caption="" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8329.jpeg" caption="" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8330.jpeg" caption="" %}

As you can see in the video at the start of this post, the fix worked fine.

Overall an excellent day and thanks to Rod for his hospitality.
