Fished [Meon Springs](http://www.meonsprings.com) yesterday. It was my first fishing trip in the UK and my first experience fishing a managed, stocked fishery. Went with Tero Rissa who got the beautiful 6.5 pound hen rainbow trout in the picture. A good place to take someone flyfishing for the first time but those stocked fish behave very differently to wild ones. A bit like shooting fish in a barrel though, think I'll try [Grafham Water](http://www.gwffa-grafham.co.uk/grafham.htm) next - at least you can see it on the map.
