Went to visit Cousin Kwan and his wife Kim in [Seventeen Seventy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_Seventy,_Queensland).

To get there I first flew to Brisbane.

Then took a Dash-8 turboprop flight to Budaberg (I'd forgotten how noisy propeller planes were).

Didn't get to Kwan's farm until late but our first project was to try to fix Kwan's Simrad fishfinder.

We needed a new FFC/FPC flat ribbon cable.

All fixed!

Pano of Kwan's farm.

This fuel bill exceeded the price of my first car.

We weren't sure about the weather but chanced it with a midday start. Turned out the conditions were pretty good and the swell was much less than the forecast.

We cast to a school of tuna but didn't manage to fool them. There were plenty of dolphins around. We started catching a fish on every cast using a metal lure generously given to me by Yufei.  

It wasn't long before I hooked a really solid fish with my 10kg travel rod. This is what the fish thought of my tackle.

The first decent fish we landed was a golden travelly on the lure.

Then a cobia slammed my bait. After a really strong fight on 25kg gear, we got it in the boat.

The next day we went crabbing in Baffle Creek in Kwan's small boat. The outboard had new everything (engine control unit, water pump, carby) except fuel filter which was supposedly new because it was installed by the previous owner. Guess what didn't work?

With insufficient time, we didn't catch any crabs or mangrove jack. However, we collected fresh mullet with a cast net for the next day.

On the King's Birthday, we went offshore again with Craig. Conditions were very lumpy and not great for fishing. On the way out, the anchor release failed so we couldn't use the anchor winch.

Craig hooked up to a cobia that quickly buried him. This happened several times for all of us.

Without the anchor winch, and the wind blowing in the opposite direction to the tide, the anchor rope got tangled on both outboards. Any sensible person would have just cut the rope but that would mean we would lose the anchor and end our day of fishing. So Kwan jumped in and promptly got smashed against the knife-sharp propeller putting a large cut on his chest. In addition we had to use the other outboard to get slack in the rope while Kwan was in the water.

I was so afraid he would get churned into mince I stopped taking photos. 
Anyway, it took about 10 minutes to get everything sorted and Kwan came back into the boat with bleeding hands and chest. As an additional prize, he got bitten by stinging jellyfish.

Then we started catching fish. There were thousands of trevally around. Here is Kwan with a particularly nice one.

We could tell the next fish was big when it hit. It took Craig around the front of the boat so he passed the rod to Kwan from starboard to bow, and then back to me on the port side. The fish came up to the surface quite quickly and Craig made short work of it on his 30kg gear. After about 3 or 4 gaff shots (they are slippery and have big scales), we could take a photo of this really nice cobia.

As the conditions were quite rough, we returned to the boat ramp early.
We only took a few trevally, an emperor and the cobia.

The cobia weighed about 11 kg.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2025/06/IMG_1139.jpeg" caption="" %}

Quite a lot of fillets.

On the final day we tested a 45kW sandblaster that Kwan picked up for a song. A little redneck engineering was involved, but we think it needs more power on startup than Kwan's 3-phase inverter can supply.

We finished the trip with a fire, as it got bitterly cold (down to about 15 celcius that night). Thanks so much to Kwan, Kim and Craig for their hospitality and making this a truly memorable trip.
