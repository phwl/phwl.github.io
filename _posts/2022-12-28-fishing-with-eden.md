A repeat trip with Derek (Warren's brother) and his 12-year old son Eden.
Here is the report from 2019 <http://phwl.org/2019/fishing-trip-with-eden/>.

We arrived a bit late at 6:30am and fishing until 9:30am without a touch
when Warren pulled this flathead from under a boat.

Then coffee at Careel Bay.

Near the high tide, seagulls and terns were diving and the salmon and tailor came on the bite.
