My boat trailer is about 10 years old and on the original set of bearings. I guess it's time to change them.

# Introduction

Here is a really good diagram showing the entire assembly.

# Tyres
I've had my [Stacer Outlaw 429]({% link _posts/2015-10-18-stacer-outlaw-429.md %}) since 2015. I don't do very many miles as I only drive to  the local boat ramp. When I stop I always check the bearings aren't hot. Anually, I jack it up and spin the wheels to check for noise or side-to-side play.

30/10/2024 Just was I was wondering whether or not I should replace the tyres (it is recommended to change them after [10 years](https://tyregeek.com.au/when-to-replace-tyres), the right had a crack near the valve. Bought 2 new wheels and tyres from <https://sunriseint.com.au/>. The reason I bought wheels was so I can use one of the old ones as a spare.

The wheels/tyres were Galvanised 155R13C (commercial rather than light truck) and were $104 each. The Stacer trailer has a Holden HT stud pattern. The tyres came inflated to 46 psi.

The stud size is 7/16" and the lug nuts should be torqued to 70-80 ft lbs. The tightening sequence is here <https://www.tirerack.com/upgrade-garage/how-do-i-properly-torque-my-wheel-lug-nuts-or-bolts>.

I replace the wheels and tyres first.

# Wheel and hub removal

First the Bearing Buddies come off. You tap them from side to side with a hammer to get them to come out. I don't like these original ones, my grease gun always stuck to the nipple. For this reason I didn't grease it very often.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8144.jpeg" caption="" %}

The grease looks pretty old.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8145.jpeg" caption="" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8146.jpeg" caption="" %}

Wipe off the old grease and then remove the cotter pin with pliers.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8147.jpeg" caption="" %}

Now the wheel can come off. Make sure you chock the wheels on the opposite side before you jack up the trailer!
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8149.jpeg" caption="" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8162.jpeg" caption="" %}

Take the tyre off.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8151.jpeg" caption="" %}

The whole hub should come off now. Sometimes you need to lightly tap it from behind with a hammer.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8152.jpeg" caption="" %}

Good, the old bearing is a LM11949/10 so I purchased the right ones!
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8154.jpeg" caption="" %}

Gave the old bearings a quick wash in kerosene. They weren't in really bad condition.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8188.jpeg" caption="" %}

Clean out all the old grease on the axle.


# New Bearings
I purchased hubs and bearings from [Huntsman Products](https://www.huntsmanproducts.com.au/) on Ebay:
* [X2 HT Trailer Galvanised Disc Hubs with LM Holden Bearings](https://www.huntsmanproducts.com.au/products/ht-trailer-galvanised-disc-hubs-x-2-with-lm-holden-bearings)
* [Upgrade to Koyo Japanese Bearing kit](https://www.huntsmanproducts.com.au/products/upgrade-to-japanese-bearing-kit-single-axle-lm-or-s-l-bearings).
The bearings are:
* ¾” Cone – LM11949/10 Bearing
* 1 ¼” Cone – LM67048/10 Bearing.
The bearing race came pressed onto the hub. It's much less work to just buy these "Easy Hubs" and throw away the old one. In my case, I'll need to remove the race from the old hub as I want to use it as a spare.

I also chose Penrite Marine Grease.

You put grease on your palm and then press it from the bottom until it appears at the top. Needless to say it's a super messy process.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8148.jpeg" caption="" %}

Here they are all done.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8155.jpeg" caption="" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8156.jpeg" caption="" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8157.jpeg" caption="" %}

Put the inner bearing in the hub.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8169.jpeg" caption="" %}

Put grease in the gap.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8170.jpeg" caption="" %}

Now hammer the double lip seal into the hub.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8171.jpeg" caption="" %}

I use an old spanner to balance the force.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8173.jpeg" caption="" %}

Now put the rubber part of the lip seal on the axle.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8174.jpeg" caption="" %}

Then the hub and spindle washer.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8175.jpeg" caption="" %}

Axle nut.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8176.jpeg" caption="" %}

Put in the cotter pin.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8177.jpeg" caption="" %}

Check the wheel spins freely.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8179.jpeg" caption="" %}

Now you can bend the cotter pin.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8180.jpeg" caption="" %}

Set the wheel back on the ground and
tighten to 70-80 ft lbs using a [star pattern](https://australianoffroad.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Wheel-Nut-Torque-Settings-Information-Sheet-3.pdf).
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8181.jpeg" caption="" %}

Tap in the Bearing Buddies.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8185.jpeg" caption="" %}

Grease the Bearing Buddies with a grease gun.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8186.jpeg" caption="" %}


# Removing Inner and Outer Race from Hub
Place a punch on the lip of the race and smash it with a hammer from different positions to move it out. When you get near the end, you'll need to support the hub so the race can fall out.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8182.jpeg" caption="" %}

It takes a bit of work but here are the inner and outer race.
