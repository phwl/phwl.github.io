My boat trailer is about 10 years old and on the original set of bearings. I guess it's time to change them.

# Introduction
The reason for this post is that I wasn't able to find a good, written description of how to change trailer bearings on the internet. There are lots of YouTube videos, many leave out steps like changing the races, which are crucial. An exception is [The TrailerSmith](https://www.youtube.com/@TheTrailerSmith) who gives really good information on all aspects of trailer maintenance.

Here is a really good diagram showing the assembly. Although I tried, I couldn't find the original source of this figure, please let me know if it is yours.

## Hubs
To identify the hub type, you need to check the stud pattern. 
For uneven stud holes such as 5 stud patterns, measure from the centre of one stud, to the furthest edge of the most opposite stud (1 to 2 in the figure above). For even stud holes such as 4 or 6 stud patterns, measure from the centre of one stud to the centre of the opposite stud. The match with the stud distance  column in the table below. If you want to be extra safe, also check the pitch circle diammeter (PCD) which is the diameter of a circle going through the center of all the studs.

## Bearings
The most common in Australia are Holden (LM) bearings and Ford (slimline) ones. 
* The best way is to check the PCD. Other ways include:
* The Holden have 11mm stud diameter and Ford 12.4mm. 
* Round 39 mm and square 40 mm axles are usually Holden and 45 mm square axles are usually Ford.

This photo below shows the new rims and tyres that I bought. They support both Holden HT and Ford hubs.

The bearing type is best determined by reading the part number of the one being replaced.

The Stacer trailer has a Holden HT stud pattern and the bearings are:
* ¾” Cone – LM11949/10 Bearing
* 1 ¼” Cone – LM67048/10 Bearing.
The rims/tyres were Galvanised 155R13C (commercial rather than light truck) and were $104 each.  The new tyres came inflated to 46 psi.

# Tyres
I've had my [Stacer Outlaw 429]({% link _posts/2015-10-18-stacer-outlaw-429.md %}) since 2015. I don't do very many miles as I only drive to  the local boat ramp. When I stop I always check the bearings aren't hot. Anually, I jack it up and spin the wheels to check for noise or side-to-side play.

30/10/2024 Just was I was wondering whether or not I should replace the tyres (it is recommended to change them after [10 years](https://tyregeek.com.au/when-to-replace-tyres), the right had a crack near the valve. Bought 2 new rims and tyres from <https://sunriseint.com.au/>). The reason I bought new rims was to use one of the old ones as a spare.

The lug nuts should be torqued to 70-80 ft lbs. The tightening sequence is here <https://www.tirerack.com/upgrade-garage/how-do-i-properly-torque-my-wheel-lug-nuts-or-bolts> and below.

# Wheel and hub removal

First the Bearing Buddies come off. You tap them from side to side with a hammer to get them to come out. I don't like these original ones, my grease gun always stuck to the nipple. For this reason I didn't grease it very often.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8144.jpeg" caption="" %}

The grease looks pretty old. I really should have repacked the bearings sooner.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8145.jpeg" caption="" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8146.jpeg" caption="" %}

Wipe off the old grease and then remove the cotter pin with pliers.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8147.jpeg" caption="" %}

Now the wheel can come off. Undo the lug nuts first and make sure you chock the wheels on the opposite side before you jack up the trailer!

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8162.jpeg" caption="" %}

Take of the wheel. Then remove the axle nut using a spanner or water pump pliers.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8151.jpeg" caption="" %}

The whole hub should come off now. Sometimes you need to lightly tap it from behind with a hammer. I had to do this on the other side.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8152.jpeg" caption="" %}

Good, the old bearing is a LM11949/10 so I purchased the right ones!
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8154.jpeg" caption="" %}

Gave the old bearings a quick wash in kerosene. They weren't in bad condition, you can see some lines on the rollers but no deep scoring or chipping.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8188.jpeg" caption="" %}

Clean out all the old grease on the axle.


# New Bearings
I purchased hubs and bearings from [Huntsman Products](https://www.huntsmanproducts.com.au/) on Ebay:
* [X2 HT Trailer Galvanised Disc Hubs with LM Holden Bearings](https://www.huntsmanproducts.com.au/products/ht-trailer-galvanised-disc-hubs-x-2-with-lm-holden-bearings)
* [Upgrade to Koyo Japanese Bearing kit](https://www.huntsmanproducts.com.au/products/upgrade-to-japanese-bearing-kit-single-axle-lm-or-s-l-bearings).
I also chose Penrite Marine Grease.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8155.jpeg" caption="" %}

Note that in my case, the bearing races came pressed onto the hub. It's much less work to just buy these "Easy Hubs" and throw away the old one. If you need to remove the old races, see the section at the end where I removed them to use it as a spare. After that, you need to hammer in the new races (using the old ones to get them inside the hub).

Then, put grease on your palm and then press it into each bearing from the bottom. What you want is for the grease to squeeze out to the top. Needless to say it's a super messy process.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8156.jpeg" caption="" %}

Here they are all done.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8157.jpeg" caption="" %}

Put the inner bearing in the race.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8169.jpeg" caption="" %}

Put grease in the gap.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8170.jpeg" caption="" %}

Now hammer the double lip seal into the hub.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8171.jpeg" caption="" %}

I use an old spanner to balance the force.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8173.jpeg" caption="" %}

Now put the rubber part of the lip seal on the axle.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8174.jpeg" caption="" %}

Then the hub, outer bearing and spindle washer.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8175.jpeg" caption="" %}

Axle nut.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8176.jpeg" caption="" %}

Put in the cotter pin.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8177.jpeg" caption="" %}

Check the wheel spins freely and check for side-to-side wobble.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8179.jpeg" caption="" %}

Now you can bend the cotter pin and firm up (but not tighten the wheel lugs).
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8180.jpeg" caption="" %}

Set the trailer back on the ground and
tighten to 70-80 ft lbs using a [star pattern](https://australianoffroad.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Wheel-Nut-Torque-Settings-Information-Sheet-3.pdf).
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8181.jpeg" caption="" %}

Tap in the Bearing Buddies.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8185.jpeg" caption="" %}

Grease the Bearing Buddies with a grease gun.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8186.jpeg" caption="" %}


# Removing Inner and Outer Race from Hub
Place a punch on the lip of the race and smash it with a hammer from different positions to move it out. When you get near the end, you'll need to support the hub so the race can fall out.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8182.jpeg" caption="" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2024/10/IMG_8183.jpeg" caption="" %}

It takes a bit of work but here are the inner and outer races.
