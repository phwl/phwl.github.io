Wanted to make a box for my camp kitchen for a while.

<!-- more -->

This is a more utilitarian version of <https://www.popularwoodworking.com/woodworking-blogs/326395/>.
Starting with a piece of plywood that had been lying in the garage for 
so long it had a suntan. First cut the sides.

Check that it will be roughly the right size.

Using a router, make through dados to align the box.

Glue up the 4 sides

and clamp.

Cut the top and bottom.

Glue and nail together. A bit ugly but it will do.

Make the handles.

Some light sanding just to clean up the plywood.

Paint with marine varnish to protect.

Here we have: 2 plates, cup and pot (there is a small gas stove in
the pot on the left), knife, 2 cutlery sets, another pot, 2 cups, 
fuel and main stove.

That's more than I would usually take and it all fits in the box.

I'm looking forward to using it outdoors.
