An awesome fishing report that Michael Zhu sent to me via Facebook Messenger.

Dear Phil, our group of four people boarded Brain's chart boat (big boat licensed for 15- standard package of 8 person) at Jerseyville, South West Rocks. We had one Aussie, two Swedish men and me. Here is a photo of us at 6am this morning.

We collected  Slimy mackerel at the bait ground - while we catching bait fish I got two striped tuna. Boat traveled along the coast line to near grassy head adjacent to continent shelf with water depth ~30m.

Live slimy mackerel was very effective. In 10 minutes we managed to catch our 1st big mackerel and within one hour we caught average 3 mackerel each. We lost a couple as well. One Swedish guy took a little long time fish getting it in, this resulting in a "haircut" by a shark!

At 10am we moved to a depth of 55m for bottom fish but we didn't do much good ...2 Sergeant Bakers a couple of ocean flathead and a red rock cod. I caught a school mackerel.

When we returned to jetty at noon, another chart boat that was targeting Jewfish caught two...
