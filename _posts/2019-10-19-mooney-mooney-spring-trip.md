This was the first trip to Mooney Mooney for the season. We were on the
way to Milson Island when the engine started hesitating and then stopped.

Fortunately, it was because the fuel line had fallen off the tank and
we were soon underway again.

On the second cast, we caught a nice flathead.

Followed by a succession of stingrays (4 in total for the day).

The jellyfish were present in plague proportions.

We were being blown straight into shore so we dropped the anchor and had
coffee while fishing.

Houses around Milson Island.

Not much was happening so we were back around midday, just as the wind was
picking up (later in the day it was 40 km/h).

This pelican was well fed, took a flathead frame but didn't want any more.
