I've never heard of anyone have problems with their oven but when my wife 
opened the door a few days ago it went bang.

<!-- more -->
The symptom was that it would trip the residual current device (RCD) circuit breaker as soon as you turn the
left knob to any position other than the light.

First you push down the little tabs on each side to release the door.

Then there are two little self-tapping screws in the left and rightmost black plastic coverings that screw it into the recess.

After that the oven comes straight out. It's not too heavy, maybe about 10 kgs.

Following the power cable, the top part looks fine.

Here are the connections to the top heating element. They looked ok as well.

The four terminals at the bottom were those for the bottom element. The
inside one had low resistance to earth so I unplugged them and the oven
stopped tripping the RCD.

Pulled out the bottom element. Notice the insulation of the second terminal
is charred. That must be the problem!
