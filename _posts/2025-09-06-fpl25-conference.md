Had a very busy schedule for a trip to the [FPL 2025 conference](https://2025.fpl.org/) in Leiden.

## Amsterdam
I flew via Dubai and arrived in the afternoon. Here is a photo of
one of the canals in Amsterdam.

That evening we took the train to Leuven and had raw pickled herring.

Had dinner in this restaurant with a strange entrance where one walks through a cupboard.

## Day trip to Leuven

In retrospect, a day trip from Leiden to Leuven was not a great idea as an 11 hour trip for a 2 hour meeting was not exactly relaxing.

This is the square opposite the Leuven train station.

At least they have a sense of humour at IMEC.

## Leiden
The main purpose of the trip was to attend the FPL conference.

A very clever canape. It's a piece of sushi and the plastic bottle is soy sauce.

On the second day of the conference, we took a walk around Leiden City.

An old windmill.

Rembrandt's birthplace.

A castle in the city.

Before the conference dinner on the Leiden University campus, we got talking to a professor who kindly took us on an impromptu tour of the original building of Leiden University (which is a former church).

This is the room in the central building at Leiden University where they do PhD vivas. Portraits of senior professors line the walls.

## Amsterdam

On the last day, we went to [Jazz Cafe Alto](https://www.jazz-cafe-alto.nl/) and had a great time. [Francisco Morales](https://franciscomoralesmusic.com/) was playing.
