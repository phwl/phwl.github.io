Here is how you tell what types of trailer bearings you have without taking them out.

{% include figure image_path="https://www.mywestshore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Boat-Trailer-Bearing.jpg" %}

A clear explanation is given here [https://trailersparesdirect.com.au/blogs/technical-info/identifying-hub-types](https://trailersparesdirect.com.au/blogs/technical-info/identifying-hub-types) and this [pdf](/assets/images/2021/03/bearing_technical_guide.pdf) is also helpful.

In summary, measure from centre of one stud to the next stud:
 * 64MM = HT HOLDEN
 * 68MM = FORD
 * 70MM = HQ

Also check the axle:
 * 39mm Round Axles - 750kg maximum operating weight per Axle. Runs LM (Holden) bearings
 * 40mm Square Axles - 1000kg maximum operating weight per Axle. Runs LM (Holden) bearings
 * 45mm Square Axles - 1500kg maximum operating weight per Axle. Runs SL (Ford) bearings

Here are the part numbers.
```
LM (Holden bearings) suit 39mm Round & 40 mm Square Axles - 1000kg weight capacity / pair
路 Outer (small) bearings # LM 11949 - Bearing
 # LM 11910 - Cup
路 Inner (large) bearings # LM 67048 - Bearing
 # LM 67010 - Cup
```

```
SL (Ford bearings) suit 45mm Square Axles - 1400kg weight capacity / pair
路 Outer (small) bearings # L 12749 - Bearing
 # L 12710 - Cup
路 Inner (large) bearings # L 68149 - Bearing
 # L 68110 - Cup
```
