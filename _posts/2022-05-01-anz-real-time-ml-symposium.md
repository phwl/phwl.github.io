[The Quantum Terminal](https://thequantumterminal.com/#thelocation), 1 Eddy Avenue, Haymarket 2000 

The symposium is hosted by The University of Sydney (USYD) and the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) through the Digital Central Initiative, and by AMD.

The goal of this symposium is to provide a forum for the discussion of opportunities for collaboration between industry and academia in real-time machine learning (ML) and high performance computing (HPC) in the Australian/New Zealand (ANZ) region.

Topics include real-time machine learning (ML) and high performance computing (HPC) using AMD CPU/GPU and FPGA technology.

Attendees will have a chance to see real-time machine learning demos from AMD.

Please arrive at 1.45pm for a 2pm start.

Location: The Quantum Terminal, [Central Station Grand Concourse Light Rail Stop (L1)](https://nswtrains.fandom.com/wiki/Central_Grand_Concourse_Light_Rail_station), Sydney.
