My Honda HRU19D has gone 10 years without a service.

<!-- more -->

The closest manual I could find is
the one for the [HRU19K1](/assets/images/2020/04/hru19k1.pdf).
While there are lots of good videos on this (such as 
[eReplacementParts.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2NcBVRMvKs)
and [Bruce Pender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkRnySSd5hA)), for those of us
that prefer to read, here are step by step instructions. 

In the past year, this mower has become hard to start. Needs a carby
clean and while I'm at it, might as well service everything.

## Carburettor and Air Filter
### Step 1 Air filter
Shut off the fuel valve on the hose that runs into the carby.
Take off the air filter cover and the 2x 10mm bolts that go into the
engine. Examine air filter and replace if bad.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/mower4.jpeg" caption="" %}

### Step 2 Fuel Hose
Undo the hose underneath (fuel line). You need to pull the retaining
clip out of the way with pliers and then slide off the hose.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/mower6.jpeg" caption="" %}

### Step 3 Linkages
Tilt the carby and undo the 3 linkages. 
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/mower7.jpeg" caption="" %}

### Step 4 Remove carby
It should come out now. It's pretty dirty.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/mower8.jpeg" caption="" %}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/mower9.jpeg" caption="" %}

At this point I should have removed the front and read gaskets but I did
this in the middle of Step 6.

### Step 5 Float Bowl 
Turn it upside down and undo the 10mm nut. Remove the bowl.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/mower10.jpeg" caption="" %}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/mower11.jpeg" caption="" %}

### Step 6 Float
Remove the float pin and then the float.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/mower14.jpeg" caption="" %}

It is at this point I removed the front and rear gaskets.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/mower19.jpeg" caption="" %}

Don't lose the float valve that attaches to the float.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/mower18.jpeg" caption="" %}

### Step 7 Main Jet
Using a flat blade screwdriver, unscrew the main jet and tap the size of the carby until it comes out..
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/mower16.jpeg" caption="" %}

### Step 8 Main Nozzle
After some more tapping the main nozzle should come out.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/mower17.jpeg" caption="" %}

### Step 9 Clean
Everything looked relatively clean and nothing was clogged, so I didn't want to mess with the idle screw etc to take it down further (see for how to do this [eReplacementParts.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2NcBVRMvKs)).
Clean everything with carburettor cleaner, paying particular attention
to the air flow and fuel flow paths indicated in the figure below.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/mower20.jpeg" caption="" %}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/mower22.jpeg" caption="" %}

### Step 10 Put Back Together
Put everything back together.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/mower21.jpeg" caption="" %}

## Oil Change
### Step 1 Check Oil
Remove the dip stick, check the oil level and look at the colour of the oil. Mine had not been
used much the previous summer and looked good so I'll change it next year.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/blade12.jpeg" caption="" %}

### Step 2 Change oil
If you need to change the oil, do so when it is warm. Close the fuel 
valve and tip the oil out at the dipstick opening. Use SAE 10W-30 
4 stroke oil.

## Spark Plugs
### Step 1 Remove Cable
Remove spark plug cable.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/plug1.jpeg" caption="" %}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/plug2.jpeg" caption="" %}

### Step 2 Remove Plug
Remove spark plug. It is a NGK BPR5ES.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/plug3.jpeg" caption="" %}

Socket is 13/16".
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/plug4.jpeg" caption="" %}

### Step 3 Check Plug
Examine electrode, looks good.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/plug5.jpeg" caption="" %}

Gap is supposed to be 0.7-0.8 mm so let's go with 0.75 mm.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/plug6.jpeg" caption="" %}

### Step 4 Put Back Together
Put everything back. Don't overtighten.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/plug7.jpeg" caption="" %}


## Blade replacement
### Step 1 Remove Cable
Remove spark plug cable (so engine can't start on you).
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/plug2.jpeg" caption="" %}

### Step 2 Turn on Side and Remove Blade Disc
Turn off the fuel valve and turn on its side with the air filter facing up.
Use a block of wood to wedge the blade so it won't turn. Using a 14 mm
socket, undo the nut for the blade disc.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/blade1.jpeg" caption="" %}

### Step 3 Examine blade
Mine were in bad shape. 
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/blade4.jpeg" caption="" %}

The part number for 4x the normal height blades is 06720-VK0-600. It took me a while to
find this handy table.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/hondablades.jpeg" caption="" %}
I purchased 
[new blades](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Genuine-Honda-Blades-19-Blade-kit-set-of-4-06720-VK0-600/323806462925?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649)
from [Online Mower
Spares](https://www.ebay.com.au/str/Online-Mower-Spares?_trksid=p2047675.l2563>
for $30) who I highly recommend. 

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/blade5.jpeg" caption="" %}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/blade10.jpeg" caption="" %}

### Step 4 Remove blade nuts
These were 17 mm.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/blade7.jpeg" caption="" %}

### Step 5 Clean
I used a wire brush to clean the blade disc.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/blade8.jpeg" caption="" %}

### Step 6 Attach New Blades
One thing that I didn't know is that the blades are not perpendicular 
to the disc. They are at a slightly acute angle. If you make them
perpendicular, they hit the side of the mower (only found out after I
put everything back together). 
I used the shadow of the old blade for alignment.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/blade9.jpeg" caption="" %}

### Step 7 Put Back Together
Put the cutter disc back on the mower. Replace the spark plug cable and 
open the fuel valve.
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2020/04/blade11.jpeg" caption="" %}

## Try it Out
Works like new now. Since the main jet and main nozzle looked clean, I 
suspect the problem was the float not moving properly. The mower now 
starts easily and cuts cleanly. Even the sound is different from having 
cleaned off the caked-on grass.
