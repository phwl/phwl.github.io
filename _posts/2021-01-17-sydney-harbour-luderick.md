Went for a fish in Sydney Harbour with Beard this afternoon.

Arrived near the bottom of the low tide, water was murky which is
good.  On the first drift I caught this luderick and we thought it
would be a great afternoon. Unfortunately, nothing else happened
for the rest of the afternoon. At least I successfully field tested
a new hat - always a risky change.

I like them fried!
