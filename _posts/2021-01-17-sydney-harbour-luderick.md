Went for a fish in Sydney Harbour with Beard this afternoon.

Arrived near the bottom of the low tide, water was murky which is
good.  On the first drift I caught this luderick and we thought it
would be a great afternoon. Then nothing happened for the rest of
the afternoon. At least I opened my account for the year!
