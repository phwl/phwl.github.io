A really good entry to the [International Obsfucated C Code Contest](https://www.ioccc.org).

[This entry](https://www.ioccc.org/2018/mills/hint.html), by Christopher Mills - PDP-7/11 simulator, won the Best of Show in 2018. Here are the notes:

The program delivered here is both a full machine emulation of the original PDP-7 that Ken Thompson used to write the first version of UNIX and a full machine emulation of the PDP-11/40 used by subsequent UNIXes.
The Makefile can build versions that can run each of the following:

    1. UNIX v0 for the PDP-7 (circa 1969)
    2. Research UNIX Version 6 (circa 1975)
    3. BSD 2.9 (circa 1983)
