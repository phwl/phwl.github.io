A really good and relatively inexpensive 2m/70cm handie talkie is the Yaesu VX-6R. It covers 144-430 Mhz and is extremely rugged.

# Programming
Until today, I only had manually stored repeaters because I
didn't want to pay [USD49](https://www.rtsystemsinc.com/ADMS-VX6-Programming-Software-and-USB-57B-cable-for-the-Yaesu-VX-6_p_131.html) for a cable
and haven't gotten around to making one. 

I read on 
<https://blog.marxy.org/2021/11/programming-yaesu-vx-6-with-chirp.html>
that [this cable](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33047585075.html) was available for about $15 from Aliexpress. I had previously purchased one but 
it didn't work. 

The cable uses the Prolific PL2303TA chip. I started with Windows 11 because
I thought that would be the easiest. When the cable was plugged in, the Device
Manager said "PL2303TA DO NOT SUPPORT WINDOWS 11 OR LATER, PLEASE CONTACT YOUR SUPPLIER". A search revealed [this](https://chirp.danplanet.com/issues/9509) which
led me [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-11/pl2303-issues-prolific-usb-to-serial-drivers-win-11/m-p/2966957). That led me [here](http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?p_id=225&pcid=41) and the "DCHU (for PC Vendors)" Windows 11 or higher PL2303D Driver v3.9.0.2 dated 27/7/2021. Installing that manually fixes this problem.

I used the excellent [CHIRP](https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home)
software on an x86 Macbook and the process was very similar to 
the Icom IC-2730A (see [here](https://phwl.org/2018/how-to-program-australian-repeaters-into-an-icom-ic-2730a-using-chirp/)). 

1. Obtain the WIA Australian repeater directory from <http://www.wia.org.au/members/repeaters/data/> (the “Example VBScript, Sorted Directory csv and CHIRP csv files and other csv formats” file) and unzip.
2. In Chirp, 
 - Download the radio data using the Radio -> Download from radio menu and select the appropriate radio. 
 - Follow the instructions regarding putting radio into Clone mode and 
pressing [BAND] after clicking OK
 - File -> Import the appropriate csv file from the chirp directory. I used NSW\chirp_Sydney.csv with a "+1" in "Adjust New Location" to map entry 0 in the
CSV to 1 for the radio. 
 - Radio -> Upload and follow instructions.
