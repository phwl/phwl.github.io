A really good and relatively inexpensive 2m/70cm handie talkie (HT) is the Yaesu VX-6R. It is compact and rugged.

# Review
The radio has a wideband receiver covering 
* 0.5 - 1.8 MHz (BC Band)
* 1.8 - 30 MHz (AM Shortwave Band)
* 30 -  59 MHz (6 Meter Amateur)
* 59 - 108 MHz (FM)
* 108 - 137 MHz (Air Band)
* 137 - 174 MHz (144 MHz HAM and VHF marine channels)
* 174 - 222 MHz (VHF-TV)
* 222 - 420 MHz (ACT1: Action Band 1)
* 420 - 470 MHz (430 MHz HAM)
* 470 - 729 MHz (UHF-TV)
* 803 - 998.99 MHz (ACT2: Action Band 2 Cellular Blocked) 
With the transmit mod mentioned later, it can transmit on any frequency.

The radio is small and has an IPX7 waterproof rating so it's the
one I carry when I need a 2m HT. I use it mainly to speak on the
[MWRS repeater](https://www.mwrs.org.au/mwrs-landing/vk2rmb-repeater-systems/)
and on the boat.

The only thing I don't like is that the menu system is overly 
complicated. I need to refer to the manual too often.

Here are a number of other reviews of the radio:

# Programming
Although I have had this radio for about 3 years, I never used the 
computer interface because I
didn't want to pay [USD60](https://www.amazon.com/Yaesu-VX-6R-Cable-Programming-Software/dp/B004H5Q8IM) for a cable
and hadn't gotten around to [making one](http://ad7gd.net/vx6/datacable.html). 
I read on Peter VK2TPM's [blog](https://blog.marxy.org/2021/11/programming-yaesu-vx-6-with-chirp.html)
that [this $15 cable](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33047585075.html) was available from Aliexpress. 

The cable uses the Prolific PL2303TA chip. I started with Windows 11 because
I thought that would be the easiest. When the cable was plugged in, the Device
Manager said "PL2303TA DO NOT SUPPORT WINDOWS 11 OR LATER, PLEASE CONTACT YOUR SUPPLIER". A search revealed [this](https://chirp.danplanet.com/issues/9509) which
led me [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-11/pl2303-issues-prolific-usb-to-serial-drivers-win-11/m-p/2966957). That led me [here](http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?p_id=225&pcid=41) and the "DCHU (for PC Vendors)" Windows 11 or higher PL2303D Driver v3.9.0.2 dated 27/7/2021. Installing that manually fixes this problem.

I used the excellent [CHIRP](https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home)
software on an x86 Macbook and the process was very similar to 
the Icom IC-2730A (see [here](https://phwl.org/2018/how-to-program-australian-repeaters-into-an-icom-ic-2730a-using-chirp/)). 

1. Obtain the WIA Australian repeater directory from <http://www.wia.org.au/members/repeaters/data/> (the “Example VBScript, Sorted Directory csv and CHIRP csv files and other csv formats” file) and unzip.
2. In Chirp, 
 - Download the radio data using the Radio -> Download from radio menu and select the appropriate radio. 
 - Follow the instructions regarding putting radio into Clone mode and 
pressing [BAND] after clicking OK
 - File -> Import the appropriate csv file from the chirp directory. I used NSW\chirp_Sydney.csv with a "+1" in "Adjust New Location" to map entry 0 in the
CSV to 1 for the radio. 
 - Radio -> Upload and follow instructions.

# Problems
Seems like a common problem is that the squelch is on for all channels.
This is caused by a failed 450 kHz ceramic filter.
[This video](https://youtu.be/MFyehZ2hg1I) explains the repair.

# Modifications
A number of VX6 mods, including enabling transmission at any frequency
is available from  <http://www.hampedia.net/yaesu/vx-6r-tx-mod.php>
and <https://www.g7syw.com/vx6-r-wideband-mod/>
