Hosted by Prof Hiroki Nakahara and Prof Yuko Hara-Azumi, I gave a talk entitled "Large Scale FPGA Implementations of Machine Learning Algorithms" (slides available at [phwl.org/talks](http://phwl.org/talks)) at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. The highlight was a visit to the Tsubame 3.0 supercomputer. In the photo below, from left to right, myself, Prof Yuko Hara-Azumi (Tokyo Tech), Prof Nachiket Kapre (Waterloo) and Prof Hiroki Nakahara (Tokyo Tech).

The machine was ranked first in the [Green 500](https://www.top500.org/green500/) List (June 2017), in which it achieved 14.1 GFlops/Watt Linpack efficiency, and 13nd in the [Top 500](https://www.top500.org) (November 2017). It has 36,288 cores and has a Linpack performance of 1998 TFlop/s, drawing a remarkable 142 kW.
