This is Clear Water Temple itself, with a view of Kyoto in the background. Built in 1633, it is a magnificent piece of carpentry.

Massive pieces of timber were used and lots of fancy joints.

This picture is actually quite misleading as autumn was long over.[![](http://phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PC123671.jpg){: .align-center}](http://phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PC123671.jpg)

We then took the bus to nearby Gion.

Of all the places we visited, I was most impressed by Nijo Castle and its surrounding gardens.

Japanese knives are only ground on one side (chisel grind) and hence are either left or right handed. This was part of the left handed offerings.

We then went to a ryokan on Lake Biwa, the largest freshwater lake in Japan,[![](http://www.phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PC144095.jpg){: .align-center}](http://www.phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PC144095.jpg)

Following the visit to Lake Biwa, we went to Kyoto station and took the train to Osaka.[![](http://www.phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PC144082.jpg){: .align-center}](http://www.phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PC144082.jpg)

In Osaka, it is easy to tell which restaurants specialise in what food.

Overall, we had a great time in Kyoto and Osaka. This was the first time I've been there and I would definitely not pass up an opportunity to return.
