Following the [International Conference on Field Programmable Technology](http://www.icfpt.org)Â we spent some time in Kyoto and Osaka.

Clear Water Temple is a World Heritage Site. Here are some schoolgirls playing with water.

Prayer cards.

Nice hat.

This is Clear Water Temple itself, with a view of Kyoto in the background. Built in 1633, it is a magnificent piece of carpentry.

Massive pieces of timber were used and lots of fancy joints.

This picture is actually quite misleading as autumn was long over.

We then took the bus to nearby Gion.

Many tourists enjoy dressing up in kimonos and taking selfies.

Japanese marbled beef restaurant.

{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC123809.jpg" %}

The Shinto Fushimi Inari Shrine with many torii gates.

Of all the places we visited, I was most impressed by Nijo Castle and its surrounding gardens.

{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC133982.jpg" %}

{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC133977.jpg" %}

A serious mortise and tenon.
{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC133959.jpg" %}

Nishiki market.

{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC133938.jpg" %}

A simple breakfast.

{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC133859.jpg" %}

Japanese knives are only ground on one side (chisel grind) and hence are either left or right handed. This was part of the left handed offerings.

Sharpening bench.
{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC133891.jpg" %}

Not sure if he is applying his maker's stamp here.
{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC133903.jpg" %}

We then went to a ryokan on Lake Biwa, the largest freshwater lake in Japan,
{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC144095.jpg" %}
and played camping.
{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC144143.jpg" %}

A private spa in the ryokan.
{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC154157.jpg" %}



A bit of a feast with Japanese marbled beef, sashimi and crab.
{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC144121.jpg" %}

Following the visit to Lake Biwa, we went to Kyoto station and took the train to Osaka.
{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC144082.jpg" %}

{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC154233.jpg" %}

Pedestrians have to share the pavement with cyclists.
{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC154216.jpg" %}

A professional hitman with his wife.
{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC154209.jpg" %}

In Osaka, it is easy to tell which restaurants specialise in what food.

{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC154205.jpg" %}

Didn't try this.

{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC154175.jpg" %}

Noodle bar.
{%include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/12/PC1541821.jpg" %}

Overall, we had a great time in Kyoto and Osaka. This was the first time I've been there and I would definitely not pass up an opportunity to return.
