Schnitzel dinner. (clockwise) Martin, Peter, Axel DL1FAK, Marcel DC5MB, Martin DC3MKB and myself VK2APL. Axel is professor in microwave electronics and Martin visited the [MWRS](http://www.mwrs.org.au/) in Sydney earlier this year. I am collaborating in research with Peter and the two Martin's (which was the actual purpose of the visit).
