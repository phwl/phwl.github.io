The Manly Warringah Radio Society (MWRS) participated in the [2018 John Moyle Memorial Field Day](http://www.wia.org.au/members/contests/johnmoyle/), held 17-18 March. John Moyle(1908-1960) was an engineer, editor, music and art lover, and the following two-part biography by Neville Williams eloquently describes his significant contributions to radio in Australia: (1) http://messui.polygonal-moogle.com/valves/NW198909.pdf, and (2) http://messui.polygonal-moogle.com/valves/NW198910.pdf.
