After reading the April 1994 article, "Chemistry and Physics in the Kitchen"  in Scientific American, I made liquid nitrogen ice cream for the first time with Drs Barry Flower and Markus Schenkel. 

Here is a link to the article: <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15021378_Chemistry_and_Physics_in_the_Kitchen>. The photos were taken outside Electrical Engineering at the University of Sydney.
