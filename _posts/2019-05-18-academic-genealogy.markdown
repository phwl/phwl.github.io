I visited my PhD supervisor, [Dr Marwan Anwar Jabri](http://marwanjabri.com) last week in San Francisco. He left academia to found Dilithium Networks which was then acquired by OnMobile Global Ltd. He is now Founder at Neuromorphic Systems LLC.

Marwan's supervisor was [Prof David James Skellern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_James_Skellern), who developed the first chip-set implementation of the [IEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE) [802.11a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11a) [wireless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless) networking standard. David taught the digital systems course at Sydney University when I was an undergraduate. He later became the first CEO and then Chairman of the National Information and Communications Technology Australia Ltd (NICTA).







David's supervisor was [Dr Robert Henry Frater](https://csiropedia.csiro.au/frater-robert-henry/), former CSIRO Deputy Chief Executive.
