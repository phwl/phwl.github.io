It only takes about 10 min to make a stove that burns methylated spirits from a coke can.

<!-- more -->

There are several variations but I wanted to use a standard 375 ml can, the
stove be operable without an additional stand and 
for it to be as simple as possible. The stove below is based on a
video linked at the end of this post.

First score the top of the can as shown, keep doing it until you can break
through and neatly cut off the top of the can.

Using a marker a line around the circumference of the can 5 cm (2 inches) from the bottom, and another 5.7 cm (2 1/4 inches) from the top.

Drill hole to start the cut and cut out the top and bottom. Try to leave a
piece of full width of the waste strip which we will use later as a shim.

Using a marker. make 12 marks evenly around the can.

Using needle nose pliers, make a small fold along each of the 12 marks. This 
creates a channel for the gas to flow from the bottom of the can.

At the top of each fold, make an indentation. This will be the jets of the stove.

Make a hole near the top so some gas can escape.

This is the hardest part. Push the top all the way down onto the bottom. I found that using the
shim saved from the waste made the job easier.

Then put a little methylated spirits into tbe bottom of the stove and
light. Flames should come out of the jets after about 15 seconds.

Extinguish using an old tuna can.

Here is an earlier one I made with bigger jets. The tuna can makes a good base
but you can't use it to extinguish in that case.

This youtube video shows the process.
