<!-- more -->Went to teach a [summer course in reconfigurable computing](http://www.ee.usyd.edu.au/people/philip.leong/hit-rc15.html) again at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) and to also participate in the Global Innovations Forum on Technology and Science there.

A new coffee shop appeared which is pretty good.

Streets of Harbin.

Of course, Chinese cuisine is the first choice.

I have a favourite dumpling restaurant in Harbin, near HIT.

Apart from excellent dumplings, it is worthwhile just for the translations.

Visited the [Siberian Tiger Park](http://www.dongbeihu.net.cn/) again which is always amazing.

After about 10 days in Harbin, went to Qingdao to give a talk at the [IEEE International Conference on Electronic Measurement and Instruments](http://www.icemi.cn/). Here is the view from my room on the 48th Floor of the Duoyuan Jinjiang Hotel.
