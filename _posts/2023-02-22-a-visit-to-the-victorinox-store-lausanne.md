This is the Victorinox store in Lausanne.

The Swiss Army Knife (SAK) that I've been using for the last 20 years had cracked scales. I purchased a new [Climber](https://victorinox.com.au/swiss-army-knives/climber/) with Plus scales which have two extra slots for a pen and pin.

Also visited [Heidi-Shop](https://www.swiss-knife.com/en/) where I had purchased by mail order about 10 years ago. Got there just while they were closing, but had a nice chat with the owner (I didn't get her name but I'm guessing it isn't Heidi).

Here is the finished knife (which has already collected a few scratches).
