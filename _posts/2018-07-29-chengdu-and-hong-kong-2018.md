Took a train trip to Chengdu for Sichuan food prior to the [Performance-Aware Programming with Application Accelerators (PAPAA) 2018 Workshop](http://cscpapaa.eee.hku.hk/) in Hong Kong.

There was some beautiful scenery along the way.

About 14 hours later (Hong Kong - Shenzhen - Guangzhou - Chengdu) we arrived in Chengdu. Glad we took the fast train.

This is a photo of Chengdu from our hotel above the train station.

We then moved to a hotel downtown and had Sichuan food.

Spicy noodles.

Thanks Sarimah and David for a wonderful spicy hotpot dinner.

One of the main attractions in Chengdu is the Giant Panda Breeding Research Base.

Here is a Red Panda.

We were there the entire morning and this was the only photo I made of an animate panda.

A highlight was the [Jinsha archaeological site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinsha_site) which was only discovered in 2001 (accidentally when they were digging the foundations to build units). There, they found remains of the Shu Kingdom (1200-600 BC).

They chose to leave the site as it was found.

There is also a museum where the stone, ivory, jade, bronze and gold artefacts were displayed.

Shang Dynasty chariot.

Probably the most well known exhibit, the [Golden Mask](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-05/20/content_15339234.htm).

One thing that I like very much about Sichuan is that they still have a tea culture. This has vanished from places like Beijing and Shanghai. We had tea in this beautiful tea shop near the Jiasha site.

We then took the train back to Hong Kong for the PAPAA workshop.

The workshop was hosted by Prof Hayden So at HKU and we all thank him for a wonderful event with superb food.

One of the afternoons, I went to Shenzhen to visit [CTaccel](http://www.ct-accel.com/home-2/).

I often get asked which camera I use. For this post, it was a mix of iPhone, Xiaomi 6 pro phone, Canon Ixus S120 and Olympus E-PM2. It is usually a matter of convenience as I often find it hard to tell which photo was taken with what.
