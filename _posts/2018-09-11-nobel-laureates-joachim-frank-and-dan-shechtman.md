Prof Dan Shechtman




  * _Did you worry when people (such as Linus Pauling) said your work was wrong?_ I am my own hardest critic of my own work so I verify my work over and over to ensure it is correct.


  * _How do you find what to research?_ What you should pursue comes by chance, learn lots of things, find something you are interested in and become an expert.


  * _Did Nobel Prize change your life?_ Nobel Prize is a license to do whatever you want and you have to choose what you want to do.


  * _How are things changing for the younger generation for the worse and better?Â _As technology develops we need people that are experts in different things e.g. nobody can make a cellphone by themselves. In the past you could only become an entrepreneur if your father owned a factory, now everybody has the opportunity.


Prof Joachim Frank


  * _Is it harder for researchers now than before?_ Compared to 30 years ago researchers now have tools such as the internet for communications which allow scientific collaborations that were not feasible in the past.


  * _How are things changing for the younger generation for the worse and better?_ Social media has created a dystopic environment. People need to look at their phones every 2 minutes and have serious attention deficit. Awareness has dramatically improved about world events, transcending the idea of nation states.


  * _Advice to a scientist embarking on their career. _If you have an idea that you have checked and believe in, don't let someone discourage you.
