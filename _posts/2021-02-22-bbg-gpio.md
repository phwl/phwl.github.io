This post details how to control the BeagleBone Green (BBG) via GPIO.

## 1. GPIO
Since Linux v4.8, the standard way of using Linux GPIO has been via 
[libgpiod](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libgpiod/libgpiod.git/).
Prior to the introduction of libgpiod, the
sysfs interface was used, but sysfs is depreciated and was removed from the mainline Linux kernel
in 2020. 
The best source of information on libgpiod
[comes with the library](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libgpiod/libgpiod.git/about/) and the ([libgpiod manual](http://phwl.org/assets/images/2021/02/libgpiod-ref.pdf)).

The library comes with a number of command line tools to manipulate GPIOs:
 * gpiodetect - list all gpiochips present on the system, their names, labels
               and number of GPIO lines

 * gpioinfo   - list all lines of specified gpiochips, their names, consumers,
               direction, active state and additional flags

 * gpioget    - read values of specified GPIO lines

 * gpioset    - set values of specified GPIO lines, potentially keep the lines
               exported and wait until timeout, user input or signal

 * gpiofind   - find the gpiochip name and line offset given the line name

 * gpiomon    - wait for events on GPIO lines, specify which events to watch,
               how many events to process before exiting or if the events
               should be reported to the console.

Examples:

``` sh
    # Read the value of a single GPIO line.
    $ gpioget gpiochip1 23
    0

    # Read two values at the same time. Set the active state of the lines
    # to low.
    $ gpioget --active-low gpiochip1 23 24
    1 1

    # Set values of two lines, then daemonize and wait for a signal (SIGINT or
    # SIGTERM) before releasing them.
    $ gpioset --mode=signal --background gpiochip1 23=1 24=0

    # Set the value of a single line, then exit immediately. This is useful
    # for floating pins.
    $ gpioset gpiochip1 23=1

    # Find a GPIO line by name.
    $ gpiofind "USR-LED-2" gpiochip1 23

    # Toggle a GPIO by name, then wait for the user to press ENTER.
    $ gpioset --mode=wait `gpiofind "USR-LED-2"`=1

    # Wait for three rising edge events on a single GPIO line, then exit.
    $ gpiomon --num-events=3 --rising-edge gpiochip2 3
    event:  RISING EDGE offset: 3 timestamp: [    1151.814356387]
    event:  RISING EDGE offset: 3 timestamp: [    1151.815449803]
    event:  RISING EDGE offset: 3 timestamp: [    1152.091556803]

    # Wait for a single falling edge event. Specify a custom output format.
    $ gpiomon --format="%e %o %s %n" --falling-edge gpiochip1 4 0 4 1156 615459801

    # Pause execution until a single event of any type occurs. Don't print
    # anything. Find the line by name.
    $ gpiomon --num-events=1 --silent `gpiofind "USR-IN"`

    # Monitor multiple lines, exit after the first event.
    $ gpiomon --silent --num-events=1 gpiochip0 2 3 5
```

To use it on the BBG, one must
first download the library and include files.
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libgpiod-dev
```

You can check everything is working by detecting the GPIO chips
and printing their labels and state. 
```
debian@beaglebone:~$ gpiodetect
gpiochip0 [gpio] (32 lines)
gpiochip1 [gpio] (32 lines)
gpiochip2 [gpio] (32 lines)
gpiochip3 [gpio] (32 lines)
debian@beaglebone:~$ gpioinfo
gpiochip0 - 32 lines:
	line   0:  "MDIO_DATA"       unused   input  active-high 
	line   1:   "MDIO_CLK"       unused   input  active-high 
...
```

Now turn on the D5 LED for 10 seconds using
``` bash
debian@beaglebone:~$ gpioset -m time -s 10 gpiochip1 24=1
```
and turn it off for 10 seconds
```
debian@beaglebone:~$ gpioset -m time -s 10 gpiochip1 24=0
```
Note that after ```gpioset``` exits, the data of the output is undefined.

## 2. Laboratory Experiment
### Part 1 - S2 Button Input (40%)
Download, compile and execute the ```blink``` program which flashes the D5 LED as follows

``` bash

```

Here is a listing of ```blink.c```
{% highlight C linenos %}
/*
 * **    blink.c -    blink with 1s delay 
 * */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <gpiod.h>

#define GPIOCHIP        1
#define GPIOLINE        24

int 
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        struct gpiod_chip *output_chip;
        struct gpiod_line *output_line;
        int line_value;

        /* open chip and get line */
        output_chip = gpiod_chip_open_by_number(GPIOCHIP);
        output_line = gpiod_chip_get_line(output_chip, GPIOLINE);

        /* config as output and set a description */
        gpiod_line_request_output(output_line, "blink", GPIOD_LINE_ACTIVE_STATE_HIGH);

        for (;;)
        {
                line_value = !line_value;
                gpiod_line_set_value(output_line, line_value);
                sleep(1);
        }

        return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Referring to the [libgpiod manual](http://phwl.org/assets/images/2021/02/libgpiod-ref.pdf), we obtain a descriptor for the chip specified by ```GPIOCHIP``` in line 20. Using that descriptor we obtain one for the line in line 21. 
In line 24, we configure the pin as an output, and give it the name "blink" (this is called a consumer in libgpiod). Line 28 toggles ```line_value``` between a true and false value, which is written to the line in line 29. We then sleep for 1 second before returning to the top of the infinite loop. You can press control-C to exit the program.

Modify the program so that, in addition to blinking the LED, it will
print the status of the S2 button once a second as below.
``` bash
debian@beaglebone:~$ ./blink 
S2=1
...
S2=0
```

### Part 2 - Seven Segment Display (60%)
The data sheet for a seven segment display (SSD) is available [here](https://au.element14.com/broadcom-limited/5082-7613/led-display-0-3-he-red/dp/1175576). 
 * Each segment should be driven by a BBG output which supports 6mA drive. Select 6 such pins on the P8 connector that meet this requirement.
 * Calculate the resistor value so that the current to drive the LED (voltage is 3.3V-Vf where Vf=the diode forward voltage drop) doesn't exceed 4mA.
 * Connect up the SSD to the BBG via a breadboard.
 * Program the SSD so the value changes in value 0 to 9 every second then goes back to 0. When S2 is pressed it should count backwards.
