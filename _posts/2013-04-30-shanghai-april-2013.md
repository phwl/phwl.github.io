I had an excellent trip to Shanghai last year and wrote about it in  [http://www.phwl.org/postcard-from-shanghai/](http://www.phwl.org/postcard-from-shanghai/). I was fortunate enough to be invited back.

I stayed in the Expert building, Zhangjiang Campus.

This is the library.{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2013/04/P4232072.jpg" caption="" %}

There were many highlights to this visit. Chen Shuai kindly accompanied me to visit the former residence of Soong Ching Ling, Sun Yat-sen's wife (we also went to Sun Yat-sen's former residence but that was not as interesting).

Soong Ching Ling was someone I greatly admire, She had friends like Stalin, who gave her this car.

This was one of her favourite books.
