I had an excellent trip to Shanghai last year and wrote about it in  [http://www.phwl.org/postcard-from-shanghai/](http://www.phwl.org/postcard-from-shanghai/). I was fortunate enough to be invited back.

I stayed in the Expert building, Zhangjiang Campus.

This is the library.[![](/assets/images/2013/04/P4232072.jpg){: .align-center}](/assets/images/2013/04/P4232072.jpg)

There were many highlights to this visit. Chen Shuai kindly accompanied me to visit the former residence of Soong Ching Ling, Sun Yat-sen's wife (we also went to Sun Yat-sen's former residence but that was not as interesting).

Soong Ching Ling was someone I greatly admire, She had friends like Stalin, who gave her this car.

This was a very impressive giant moving display of village life.[![](/assets/images/2013/04/P4212009.jpg){: .align-center}](/assets/images/2013/04/P4212009.jpg)

At 30 storeys, this is the tallest university building in Asia. We went there for coffee.[![](/assets/images/2013/04/P4242100.jpg){: .align-center}](/assets/images/2013/04/P4242100.jpg)
