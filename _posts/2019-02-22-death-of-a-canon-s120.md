I really liked my Canon S120 but it met its demise by being drowned in coffee. Replaced it with a very similar Canon G9X mk II which has a larger, 1" sensor. From my limited time with the new camera, it seems to take good photos but I don't like that the touch screen is needed for many operations, much shorter battery life and less zoom range. Time will tell how well this works for me.
