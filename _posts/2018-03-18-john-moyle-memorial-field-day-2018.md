The Manly Warringah Radio Society (MWRS) participated in the [2018 John Moyle Memorial Field Day](http://www.wia.org.au/members/contests/johnmoyle/), held 17-18 March. John Moyle(1908-1960) was an engineer, editor, music and art lover, and the following two-part biography by Neville Williams eloquently describes his significant contributions to radio in Australia: (1) <http://messui.polygonal-moogle.com/valves/NW198909.pdf>, and (2) <http://messui.polygonal-moogle.com/valves/NW198910.pdf>.

A full writeup is available from the MWRS website: [http://www.mwrs.org.au/2018/05/12/2018-john-moyle-memorial-field-day/](http://www.mwrs.org.au/2018/05/12/2018-john-moyle-memorial-field-day/).
