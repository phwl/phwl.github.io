Went to visit [Prickle Farmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOH92gv_xheT0AXsGkHyr5A) in [Crookwell](https://goo.gl/maps/LzuvLjxnRkrHAjR98) and photograph the sheep shearing.

Mustering the sheep into the holding paddock. I assisted the dogs by 
preventing them from escaping the other way.

Shearing is very much like ballroom dancing.

The lady on the left is putting the wool into a compactor. Prickle Farmer
and the wool handler sort the skirted fleeces and wool
pieces.

These sheep  are impatiently waiting their turn.

These will be done tomorrow.

I forgot the story behind this, will update after I've asked Prickle Farmer.

A bad accident on the Hume Highway for our return trip. Was stopped for
almost 2 hours. According to the [news](https://www.goulburnpost.com.au/story/6913805/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-hume-highway/?cs=12), it doesn't seem that anyway was badly hurt.
