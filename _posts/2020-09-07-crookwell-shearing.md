Went to visit [Prickle Farmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOH92gv_xheT0AXsGkHyr5A) in [Crookwell](https://goo.gl/maps/LzuvLjxnRkrHAjR98) and take some photographs.

Mustering the sheep into the holding paddock. I assisted the dogs by 
preventing them from escaping the other way.

Shearing is very much like ballroom dancing.

The lady on the left is putting the wool into a hydraulic compactor. Prickle Farmer
and the wool handler sort the skirted fleeces and wool pieces.
The compressed wool bale is 160 kg.

A bad accident on the Hume Highway for our return trip. Was stopped for
almost 2 hours. According to the [news](https://www.goulburnpost.com.au/story/6913805/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-hume-highway/?cs=12), it doesn't seem that anyway was badly hurt.
