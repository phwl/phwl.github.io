Over a couple of weekends, made a raised garden bed for the back garden. 

<!-- more -->
I used alkaline copper quarternary (ACQ) treated pine as other types
of treatment such as chromated copper arsenate (CCA) uses copper
and chrome arsenate, and traces of arsenic may be absorbed by the
vegetables. Bunnings lent me a handsaw to cut down the 3.6~m lengths 
so it would fit in the car.

Box went together quickly.
We weren't making furniture so it was held together with screws.

Then a couple of coats of Dulux Mission Brown which was left over from 
painting the fence.

Then into the garden.
