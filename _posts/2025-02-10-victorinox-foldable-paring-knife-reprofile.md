It's easy to modify a Victorinox Foldable Paring Knife 
to a [drop point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_point) profile.

First, use a Sharpie and French Curve (or another knife) to draw the profile 
to which you want to shape the knife.

Put the knife in a vice. Using an angle grinder with 80 grit flap disc, remove the material. Take your time to make sure you don't overheat the metal and ruin the hardness of the steel.

Use a coarse sharpening stone to finish the job. Carefully sharpen so that the new edge near the tip matches the original.

I really like this knife now. It's great for travel and camping.
