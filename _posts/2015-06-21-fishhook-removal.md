In all my years of fishing, we were fortunate not to have had a bad injury. There was the time Beard, Warren and myself tried to run a rapid on the Katherine River in the Northern Territories in a triple kayak, went upside down and Warren had a treble embedded in his foot, but fortunately it had been debarbed. There was also the time I was fishing by myself and had a hook embedded down to the barb in my tongue (long story), but I managed to get it out without much damage.

Anyway, here is a good article from the American Family Physician on hook removal ([link](http://www.aafp.org/afp/2001/0601/p2231.html), [local](/assets/images/2015/06/fishhookremoval.pdf)).
