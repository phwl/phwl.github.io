First problem I've had with my [Stacer](https://phwl.org/2015/stacer-outlaw-429/) is the live bait tank pump stopped working. Here are the steps for rectifying which took way long than it should. Hopefully this will help someone else with the same problem. I don't actually know how it got burnt out, maybe I left it on out of water?

In my Stacer 429 the middle button turns on the bait tank aerator if you push down the left hand side of the middle button.

The next photo below is a view of the other side of the panel from underneath (because I was lying on my back). If you push the left hand button, it connects to middle terminal (which is 12V) to the other side which connects to the aerator punp.

Checked the switch works, by pulling out the terminal for the aerator. You should be able to verify using a multimeter that pressing the switch makes that terminal 12V.

This is the aerator pump in place. I was very pleased to see that it was a catridge type one with replaceable catridge. All I have to do is buy one of [these cartidges](https://www.spxflow.com/johnson-pump-marine/products/cartridge-aerator-pumps/) and I won't even need to take it out and reseal the hole in the transom.

Next the floor needed to come out so I could trace the wiring.

Sloppy work, one of the screw heads snapped when it was being installed. That's because they drilled right into a weld.

The floor out of the way.

The wires for the aerator and bilge pump run from near the console along the bow side of the battery and pops out here.

At this point, cut the wires to the pump and just verify it indeed doesn't work when you connect directly to 12V e.g. the battery. That will save you a lot of hassle if it isn't the problem.

Now the recall the way the pump was installed, was like this.

The handle thing is jammed against the diagonal support so I tried to cut off the handle to release it (remember there isn't much access into there as it is through the battery hatch). With much effort I managed this and could turn the cartridge. Unfortunately, there wasn't the clearance to get it out.

Anyway, it seems you can buy the entire aerator from many places but you can't easily just buy the cartridge.
So off to BCF to buy a new aerator.

With the new aerator in hand, I learnt that the cartridge comes out a long way from the housing.

 Then I realised my Sikaflex was a little out of date. So another trip to Bunnings (Brookvale) whose web page said it was in stock but wasn't, then Bunnnings (Balgowlah) whose web page said it was in stock but wasn't, and then Whitworths where they had it in stock for twice the price of Bunnings.

Pulled the old aerator out.
Removing all of the old sealant with a scaper was not possible, even from the outside where I had good access.

The solution was a wire wheel which made quick work of it.

The new aerator in place at an angle.

Let's hope the water stays out! 

Thanks to Russell who patiently answered all my questions and suggested using Fixtech Fix15 as it's similar to the Sikaflex 291 that I used but lasts much longer in the tune (and is cheaper).
