Made a trip to Buckenderra Holiday Village on Lake Eucumbene for a very hot Australia Day weekend. Each day the maximum temperture was forcasted to be 32 C.

Didn't really have enough time to fish properly on the first evening as I 
didn't get to the water until after dark and couldn't see where to fish.
The following day we went to Jindabyne, mainly to get out of the heat.
The Red Door Roastery was very busy mid-morning.

The fishing was very tough and nobody that I spoke to at the caravan
park had caught anything. In the evening, fished some slightly
deeper water which I was hoping would be cooler. I was having a
quiet, contemplative time when the peace was disturbed by a fish
taking my Mrs Simpson (fly) so violently, it made me jump. The fish ran
towards me and I had to back pedal to keep the line tight.  It
tried to jump two or three times but didn't get very far out of the
water.  After a brief struggle I beached this fat rainbow
trout. The autopsy showed it had been feeding on stick caddis and flying
ants. I had a second hit that evening but unfortunately didn't hook up.

Returned the next morning. This sticker says it all.
