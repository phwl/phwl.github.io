It started off as a rather routine Easter fishing day trip to Mooney Mooney with
Warren.

It was a very foggy morning, worse than I've ever seen it on the Hawkesbury.
Approaching Mooney Mooney, a road sign said that the boat ramp was closed so we made a detour to Brooklyn boat ramp. That put us about an hour behind.

On one of the islands, we saw the odd scene of a really large tent and
a really small kayak. We chatted with the guy, whose name was Dong, for about 10 minutes before he casually requested that we rescue them as their inflatable boat disappeared in the middle of the night.

Since the outboard was still at the campsite, we thought it was very unlikely it had
been stolen. They had just pulled it up high onto the shore. 
They had called 000 (the Aussie equivalent of 911) who weren't interested in rescuing them. It was also
a shame that my VHF marine radio was out of service with a dead battery so I couldn't
use it to call Marine Rescue.  We said we would go fishing and come back for them.
When he mentioned he was from Wollongong, I correctly guessed he worked at Wollongong University.

The fishing was tough but we got a nice bream just as we were about to change spots.

It became a nice day as the fog cleared.

After fishing for a couple of hours, I called them and said we would be there in 20
min. During the call, I hooked a nice flathead but it broke the line within inches
of the landing net. That's the second consecutive flathead I've lost right at
the net.

When we arrived, everything was already packed in the kayak. Warren and I were
a bit worried about all the stuff in it and suggested putting the outboard in the
boat.

Anyway, Dong said not to worry so off we went.

Another boat created a large wake, which we carefully negotiated. We were just 
starting to get confident and travelling at about 4 knots.

Then the kayak flipped over. We tried to get it upright but it was too heavy to 
do so from the boat. We carefully towed it to the beach but lost the outboard.
We took everything out of the kayak and let the water drain away a bit before putting
everything in the boat. The tent took three people to lift.

With nothing in the kayak, we got up to 15 knots 
on a plane when the tow rope snapped. Definitely
a comedy of errors. We decided not to push things any further and limped back at
4 knots. 

When we arrived at the Mooney Mooney boat ramp (which was still closed), marine rescue prevented us from docking as they were towing a broken boat. They took about 20 minutes to do this simple operation and we could easily have gone in and unloaded all our stuff in
parallel.

Following the rescue we managed to catch one more bream in the middle of the day before going home. It was quite
an eventful trip and we made some new friends. Dong certainly took his misfortunes better
than I would have!
