This Stanley mattock has had a loose head for a few years now. Time to fix it 
properly.

No wonder it came loose, it was only secured with a dowel. It should
have been wedged in but I guess that's too much labour these days.
Just cut down the middle with a saw.

Then drive wedges into the groove with a hammer. I was planning to 
use PVA glue here but forgot.

Any then clean up the head.

Should be solid for a long time.
