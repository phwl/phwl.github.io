1)      Casting practice with Enrico Enrico Puglasi Flex Calamari and some sort of white popper under and around moored boat at 33⁰ 38.324’S 151⁰ 18.229’E.  Had a fish follow the popper, but no takes.
2)      Chased showing fish between 2 green buoys at 33⁰ 37.872’S 151⁰ 17.311’E and 33⁰ 38.186’S 151⁰ 16.968’E.  The 2 buoys define the entrance to Lovett Bay and Little Lovett Bay.  In and around bays we caught 4 kingfish on Flex Calamari.  1 was nearly legal.  Justin cast teaser blue and white stickbait with spinning rod and very fast retrieve to draw school into fly-rod casting distance.  He also worked the teaser in fast figure-8 maneuvers near boat to keep school nearby. Cast to schools of bonito as well to see if kingfish would follow.  Kingfish preferred slow retrieve (normal-speed strip).
3)      Cast to showing fish at entrance of Elvina Bay 33⁰ 38.377’S 151⁰ 18.984’E.  Mostly Bonito.  Bite dropped off.
4)      Went to beach-side dropoff in Morning Bay 33⁰ 37.389’S 151⁰ 17.147’E.  Saw nothing.
5)      Worked moored boats in and around 33⁰ 36.254’S 151⁰ 18.933’E.  Chased school of tailor and caught 2.
6)      Worked moored boat off Clareville Beach at 33⁰ 37.522’S 151⁰ 18.902’E, off Taylor’s Point at 33⁰ 38.303’S 151⁰ 18.256’E, and outside Salt Pan Cove at 33⁰ 38.362’S 151⁰ 18.077’E.  Saw nothing.
7)      Revisited Lovett Bay, but didn’t see anything.
8)      Briefly cast to reef off lighthouse at 33⁰ 34.628’S 151⁰ 19.827’E
9)      Saw large schools of bait near mooring at 33⁰ 36.631’S 151⁰ 19.265’E.  Caught multiple flathead near bottom with jig & soft plastic.  Caught multiple flathead, missed multiple bonito, and 2 kingfish with clouser minnow.  Cast, waited forever till it was near bottom and then very fast strip back was most effective.
