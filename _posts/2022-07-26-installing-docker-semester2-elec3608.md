Here are installation instructions for installing Docker and running the software required for 
[ELEC3608 Computer Architecture](https://cusp.sydney.edu.au/students/view-unit-page/alpha/ELEC3608).

## 1. Installation
 * (Windows 11)
   1. Install and run Docker Desktop from <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/>. In Settings, make sure "Use the WSL 2 based engine" is selected.
   1. Install WSL2 (Ubuntu) <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install> and from Windows Start, run the "Ubuntu on Windows" app

 * (MacOS)
   1. Download and install stable version from <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/> (or <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/apple-silicon/> for the M1 mac in which case the ```--platform linux/amd64``` in the command lines below are mandatory)
   1. Run Docker Desktop by clicking the Docker icon

## 2 Testing
### 2.1 Hello world
To test basic Docker functionality, type ```docker run hello-world``` in the command window. Your output should be something like:

```bash
$ docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
7050e35b49f5: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:53f1bbee2f52c39e41682ee1d388285290c5c8a76cc92b42687eecf38e0af3f0
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (arm64v8)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

```

### 2.2 X Server
We need to use the X Server to display graphical output. This
tests X Windows basic functionality.

 * (Windows setup) 
    1.  In your Ubuntu window type ```docker run -it -v /tmp/X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix fr3nd/xeyes``` 

 * (x86 MacOS X setup)
    1. Install homebrew (see ```https://brew.sh/```) 
    1. Use homebrew to install xquartz ```brew install --cask xquartz'''
    1. Run the ```Xquartz``` X Server program by clicking on the icon, an xterm window should appear
    1. Set “Allow connections from network clients” in XQuartz -> Preferences
    1. In the xterm window type (if you get an error with the xhost command, try a reboot)
    ``` bash
    $ xhost +
    access control disabled, clients can connect from any hos
    $ export DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0
    $ docker run --platform linux/amd64 -it -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY fr3nd/xeyes 
    ```

You should see a window similar to below and the eyes should move with your mouse.

![xeyes](http://phwl.org/assets/images/2022/02/docker-xeyes.png "xeyes")

### 2.3 ELEC3608 Base Image
This tests the ELEC3608 base image.
Make sure you have set up your X Server and can execute the
previous Xeyes example.

 * (Windows) From your Ubuntu window type \
 ```docker run -it -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY  -v `pwd`:/config phwl/elec3608-base:latest```
 * (MacOS x86 or M1) From xterm type \
 ```docker run --platform linux/amd64 -it -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v `pwd`:/config phwl/elec3608-base:latest```

If everything works, a prompt should appear and ```ls``` should show your local directory that was mounted.

```bash
$ ls
Dockerfile	Makefile	README.md
$ docker run --platform linux/amd64 -it -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v `pwd`:/config phwl/elec3608-base:latest

 ```
Within Docker, the directory on your local home directory will be mapped 
to your local directory. Use this to access your files and store your outputs. Verify you can also run ```xeyes```.

## 3 Troubleshooting
 * Update your operating system to the latest version. 
 * Check you have virtualization enabled in your BIOS
 * It is also possible to use MobaXterm and the instructions at <http://phwl.org/2022/installing-docker-2022-version/>.
