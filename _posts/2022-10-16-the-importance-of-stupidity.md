[The importance of stupidity in scientific research by Martin A. Schwartz](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/121/11/1771/30038/The-importance-of-stupidity-in-scientific-research) is good essay on the nature of research. It explains that research is
immersion in the unknown, we don't know what we are doing, and advocates
productive stupidity.
