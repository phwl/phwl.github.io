Hired a Toyota Hiace campervan and went for a drive to Moree via
Muswellbrook and Tamworth.

Stayed in Tamworth the first night. Had dinner at [SSS BBQ Barns Bar n Grill Tamworth ](https://www.facebook.com/sssbbq/) which I highly recommend (admittedly it doesn't look great from the outside).

Visited the [Paul Wild Observatory](https://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/)
at Narrabri. There was nobody there, not even in the Visitor Center.

This is what the main street in Moree looks like.

We stayed at the [Gwydir Thermal Pools and Caravan Park](https://www.gwydircarapark.com.au/) which has 5 Artesian pools at different temperatures (34-39 Celcius).

Amaroo Tavern has a C47 Dakota S/N 43-49377 sitting in front. It was delivered to Australia in January 1945.

During the entire trip, we were having problems with the vent of the 
camper. We couldn't close it properly and it kept moving out of position 
as we were driving. On the Newell Hwy, somewhere between Moree and Narrabri,
it flew off at 110 km/h. That was a great relief as it was a lot
less noisy and we didn't need to worry about it any more.
