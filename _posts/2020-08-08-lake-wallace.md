Went with Beard for a day trip to Lake Wallace in the Blue Mountains.
It was a rainy day but fortunately not too windy.

Didn't take long to catch a brace of rainbows. Was going to let the first one
go but took my lure very deep so I kept them.

On the way back, took more photos of the bushfire devastation near Bell.
