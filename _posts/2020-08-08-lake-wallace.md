Went with Beard for a day trip to Lake Wallace in the Blue Mountains.
It was a rainy day but fortunately not too windy.

Beard casting near the dam wall.

The first took the treble very deep (and I left my pliers in the car)
so decided to keep it.  Next came on the following cast, and shortly after
a third, smaller one which I let go.

On the way back, took more photos of the bushfire devastation near Bell.
