Went with Beard for a day trip to Lake Wallace in the Blue Mountains.
It was a rainy day but fortunately not too windy.

Beard casting near the dam wall.

The first took my Mepps lure in the brown trout pattern very deep
(and I left my pliers in the car) so decided to keep it.  The next
came on the following cast, and shortly after I caught a third,
smaller one which was let go. After 15 minutes of action, not
much else happened.

On the way back, took more photos of the bushfire devastation near Bell.
