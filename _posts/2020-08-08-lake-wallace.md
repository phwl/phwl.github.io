Went with Beard for a day trip to Lake Wallace in the Blue Mountains.
It was a rainy day but fortunately not too windy.

## Fishing
I started spinning with a Celta lure in the brown trout pattern.

The first rainbow trout took my lure very deep
down its mouth (and I left my pliers in the car) so decided to keep
it.  
The next came on the following cast, and shortly after I caught
a third, smaller one which was let go. After 15 minutes of action,
the wind changed direction and not much else happened that afternoon.

I also had a good chat with an arborist who was locking one of the gates. He, along
with other volunteers, were planting trees along the lake shore.

## Blue Mountains Bushfire Damage
On the way back, took photos of the bushfire damage from 2019 near Bell.

## Smoked Rainbow Trout
It was only the next day, while preparing the fish, that I noticed both were
tagged (sometimes, I'm not very observant). These were reported to the 
[Department of Primary Industries Tagging Program](https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fishing/recreational/resources/fish-tagging/recapture-form). One was 30cm and the 
other 31cm.

Dried the fish and covered them with salt, including the cavity. On the bottom
of a foil-lined wok I added: 1/2 cup rice, 5 tablespoons of tea and 6 bay leaves.
