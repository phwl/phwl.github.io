My mother bought this Marantz 74CD67 CD player in 1996. Twenty years later, it was unable to read reliably.

This comprehensive list of CD player mechanisms at [http://www.dutchaudioclassics.nl/philips_cdm_cd_mechanism_list/](http://www.dutchaudioclassics.nl/philips_cdm_cd_mechanism_list/) ([local copy](http://phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DutchAudioClassics.nl-Information-specifications-photos-and-service-manuals-of-Philips-Marantz-TDA1541-cd-players.pdf)) showed I needed a Philips CDM12.1 mechanism. This was easy to find on ebay as a "VAM1201 VAM1202 CDM12.1 CDM12.2 laser transport mechanism for Philips NEW". Total cost with free shipping from Hong Kong was $13.

I also found this detailed guide to replacing the laser mechanism [https://www.hifigear.co.uk/blog/marantz-cd63se-laser-transport-mechanism-replacement/](https://www.hifigear.co.uk/blog/marantz-cd63se-laser-transport-mechanism-replacement/) and the [Marantz-CD-67-SE-Service-Manual](http://phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Marantz-CD-67-SE-Service-Manual.pdf) (which wasn't that helpful for this particular repair).

Here is the player opened up.

Undo the three connectors and unscrew the CD assembly.[![](http://phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/40784864_Unknown.jpg)](http://phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/40784864_Unknown.jpg)

There is another connector for the daughter board.[![](http://phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/40784880_Unknown.jpg)](http://phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/40784880_Unknown.jpg)

The CD mechanism in its plastic sled.[![](http://phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/40784928_Unknown.jpg)](http://phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/40784928_Unknown.jpg)

The new and old look very similar.[![](http://phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/40784960_Unknown.jpg)](http://phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/40784960_Unknown.jpg)

In fact, at this point I was very pleased I took the previous photo so I could double check I didn't mix up the old and new mechanisms :-)[![](http://phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/40784976_Unknown.jpg)](http://phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/40784976_Unknown.jpg)

Put it back together and it works! Hopefully good for another 20 years.
