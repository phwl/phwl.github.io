Chris Dick was kind enough to introduce me to his friend, Dick Benson 
[W1QG](https://www.qrz.com/db/W1QG/), a retired hardware development engineer. We went to visit his
very impressive shack (which was not difficult to spot from the
road).

This is a high frequency (HF) software defined radio of his own
design, based on a Xilinx Spartan FPGA. For the signal processing
parts, he used Matlab and System Generator tools. It is documented
at
<http://k6jca.blogspot.com/2017/02/an-fpga-sdr-hf-transceiver-part-1.html>.

On one side he had his radio gear, together with a very substantial
collection of old test equipement.

He told me this is the best receiver ever made.

Not everyone has a Caesium frequency standard at home. Dick
picked it up, not working, for $300 and repaired it (had a screw
loose). I later found out the original price was $32,000 which would have
been enough to buy a house at the time.

On the other side of the workshop was his mechanical stuff,
 including a Harley
that he restored and lots of home made  radio controlled planes.

This is an engine he made from scratch, using the mill in 
the photo below.

Thanks for a wonderful visit Dick!
