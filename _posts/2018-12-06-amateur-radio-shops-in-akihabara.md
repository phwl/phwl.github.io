Passing through Tokyo this week and took the opportunity to visit a few amateur radio shops in Akihabara.{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/2018/12/DSCF5835.jpg" caption="" %}

First had an awesome Teppanyaki Lunch at the [XEX An Restaurant](http://www.xexgroup.jp/tokyo), which is on the top floor ofÂ Daimaru Tokyo, directly connected to Tokyo Station Yaesu North Exit (a very auspicious suburb name).

The best shop that I found was Rocket Amateur Radio.
