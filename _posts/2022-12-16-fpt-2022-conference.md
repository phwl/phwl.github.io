Had an amazing time at the [International Conference on Field Programmable Technology in Hong Kong](https://fpt22.hkust.edu.hk/), the [21st conference in the series](http://icfpt.org).

Stayed at the Crowne Plaza Tseung Kwan O Crowne Plaza. The COVID quarantine system was 0+3 which meant that we had to semi-quarantine for the first 3 days so we could not eat in restaurants.

Tseung Kwan O station was closed due to a faulty train.

This is Junk Bay, Tseung Kwan O is built mostly on reclaimed land. 
The lady in the boat noticed I was waiting for her to come close (so her boat would be large in the photo) and thought I wanted to buy fish.
