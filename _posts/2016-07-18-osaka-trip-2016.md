Spent a week in Osaka, the last time we were there was [2013](http://phwl.org/postcard-from-kyoto-and-osaka/).

The guy in the foreground is engraving someone's name at the Aritsugu knife shop in Nishiki Market, Kyoto. The guy in the middle is sharpening knives and I'm not sure what the lady is doing. This knife shop is one of the oldest in Japan, having been founded in 1560 (of course, the shop has not been in the market for that long). I think the sword market isn't what it used to be so they moved to knives.
