On the second weekend of Mar-Sep, the [Electronics Flea Market](https://www.electronicsfleamarket.com/) runs in the carpark of Fry's Electronics, Sunnyvale CA. I arrived at 8am because I thought I might be the only one there at the starting time of 5am.

As expected, there was a lot of test equipment.

Overall, an interesting visit and the market was not unlike [Apliu St](http://www.discoverhongkong.com/us/shop/where-to-shop/street-markets-and-shopping-streets/apliu-street-flea-market.jsp) in Hong Kong.
