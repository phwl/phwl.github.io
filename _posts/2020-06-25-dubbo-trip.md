Went for a drive to Dubbo as a cure for cabin fever.

I hadn't seen the devastation of the summer bushfires until now. At least things are starting to grow back.
Normally you would not be able to see through the trees because they'd have leaves.

Unexpectedly came across this sign, it's a long way from home.

Lunch at [Gerard's Place](https://www.facebook.com/GerardsPlaceDenman/?rf=593336600746440) in Denman which was supposed to be good but we were not too impressed. I did like the cake name.
