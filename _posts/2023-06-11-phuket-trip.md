Went for a 1 week holiday in Phuket. It was many years ago that we were last there.

The Thai Hua Museum on Krabi Road is devoted to the history of Chinese immigrants in Phuket. It is situated in the former Chinese language school. While it was very interesting, the only photo I took inside was of this bench.

The Sunday Night Market in Phuket Old Town on Thalang Road was the highlight of the trip. It's an amazing market with so many stores and people.

Even Elvis was there!

This is the Tu Kab Khao restaurant, easily recognised as there is a lobster on the side of the building, and recommended [in the Michelin Guide](https://guide.michelin.com/en/phuket-region/phuket/restaurant/tu-kab-khao). It is located in 8 Phang Nga Road, Phuket Town, Phone: 076 608 888. It is inexpensive and we ordered crab
curry, fried snapper and larb gai (chicken, basil, onion in a chilli and lime suace). This was the best Thai meal I've ever had.

Another Michelin restaurant is this one where the fried oyster omelette is excellent.

Right near the end of own stay in Old Town, we had a good chat with a durian seller.

At the mid point of the trip, we relocated to the Mariott at Merlin Beach.

Took the (rather poorly maintained) hotel bus to Patong.

Didn't try these but they look delicious.

We walked about 5 minutes from the Marriott to the Ocean Restaurant for a nice lunch. Also walked past an outfit called Bathing with Elephants but didn't enter because of allegations of cruelty.
