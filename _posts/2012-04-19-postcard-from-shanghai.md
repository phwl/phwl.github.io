Spent a fortnight over Easter in Shanghai,

<!-- more -->

as a visitor at Fudan University

![](/assets/images/2012/04/P1110572.jpg)

Played ping pong with students.

Had a ride on the maglev to the airport. As one of the websites say, it is mainly for show since the ride is only 8 min. It is impressive though, goes up to 430 km/h, quite an experience.

This is the Oriental Pearl Tower which is 468m high

and the Bund from above

It has a transparent floor, very unsettling to walk on

Street vendor.

Here people are paying to get beaten up.

Cheng Huang Temple

We visited Chairman Maoâ€™s former residence in Shanghai

![](/assets/images/2012/04/P1110832.jpg)

He was quite a poet, as was his son.

Self portrait.

Juxtaposition of old and new.

They have a wonderful canteen at Fudan. Here is part of the breakfast offering.

![](/assets/images/2012/04/P1110567.jpg)

Xiao long buns.

![](/assets/images/2012/04/P1110805.jpg)

Crab roe and vegetables.

![](/assets/images/2012/04/P1110683.jpg)

I saved the best for last, pig face jerky - quite a delicacy.

Thanks to the hospitality of my host, Professor Wang, and his students, particularly Mr Li and Mr Chen, I had a great time in Shanghai. This is the first opportunity I have had to explore this beautiful city. I look forward to my next visit.
