I had the opportunity to visit the Nelson Bay Golf Course and observe the tagging programme of semi-wild Eastern Grey Kangaroos being conducted by a colleague in Veterinary Science. Our interest in this work is to later measure the dietary intake of a number of these kangaroos using Android phones.[![OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA](http://www.phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/P7090917.jpg)](http://www.phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/P7090917.jpg)

The kangaroos are digging up the golf course and we are also trying to understand why they are doing so.

They are first tranquillised by walking up to them and jabbing them with one of these. A dart gun will probably need to be used for some of the more cautious ones.

Here is one of the tags.

We are going to fit a collar like the one below when we do our study.

Here we are checking whether a mobile phone would fit around its neck comfortably.[![OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA](http://www.phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/P7092744.jpg)](http://www.phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/P7092744.jpg)

This one weighed about 65 kg.
