These polaroids were taken by Chris. 

The first photo below was from an industrial visit to the Sydney South Substation at Picnic Point.

This is a photo of about 25% of the 4th year undergraduates. The Vietnam war was still underway and lads of our age were eligible for conscription and compulsory
