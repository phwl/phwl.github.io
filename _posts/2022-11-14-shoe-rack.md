The boss wanted me to build her a quick and dirty shoe shelf.  I
guess it is technically woodwork as medium density fibreboard (MDF)
is made with wood fibre.

First I created a lot of sawdust cutting the MDF panel into little pieces.

Next, glue on the runners.

Test fit to see if it looks right.

Glue up.

Voila, a shoe rack (and it only took about 5 hours to make). Why does
she need so many pairs of shoes?
