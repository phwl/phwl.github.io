My wife wanted me to build her a shoe rack.  Since you can
buy one from Ikea for $20 and it is hardly going to be furniture,
why not spend a day building one for considerably more?

Here is a reasonably quick construction which avoids any fancy joinery.
First cut an MDF panel to size for the sides, shelves, supports, etc.

Next, glue the supports.

Test fit to see if it looks right.

Glue up.

Voila, a shoe rack which only took about 5 hours and 2 trips to
Bunnings. Why does she need so many pairs of shoes?
