A camping trip with Warren to the Hawkesbury has become an annual event but unfortunately, we couldn't do it this year but went for a day trip. This was also our first fishing trip there in the [new boat](/2015/stacer-outlaw-429/). A 6:30am start and not a touch until about noon. Then we caught a couple of flathead and a bream in about 30 min, narrowly avoiding a doughnut.
