My daughter's LG washing machine was showing a PE (Pressure Error) code 
indicating a problem with the water level sensor.

Seemed like the things that could go wrong were the hose or sensor so
we ordered a sensor from [Mexi Trading](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/275343385265) (part number EBF62754501) - this arrived in 3 days.

Although I took the main lid off the machine, I think you only need to remove the back cover to expose the switch assembly sensor (on the right hand side of the photo above).

The tube runs down the machine to the tub.

This video covers the removal process - a pretty simple job (but one should change the hose as well)!

This shows how to test the sensor:
