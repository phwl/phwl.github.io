<p>I had the opportunity to visit the Nelson Bay Golf Course and observe the tagging programme of semi-wild Eastern Grey Kangaroos being conducted by a colleague in Veterinary Science. Our interest in this work is to later measure the dietary intake of a number of these kangaroos using Android phones.</p>
