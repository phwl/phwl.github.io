<p><strong>International Conference on Field Programmable Technology</strong>
<strong>Naha, Okinawa</strong> <a href="http://www.fpt18.sakura.ne.jp/workshop.html">http://www.fpt18.sakura.ne.jp/workshop.html</a>
<strong>December 14, 2018 (afternoon)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Organisers: David Boland and Philip Leong, The University of Sydney</strong></p>

<p>This workshop will provide a forum to discuss technical challenges and product opportunities for applying deep learning within embedded systems that take advantage of the energy and latency benefits offered by field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In particular, the following questions will be addressed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Is current academic research addressing the needs of industry? What are the new research problems important to them?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the new markets and applications created by FPGA-based machine learning?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will FPGAs be able to capture a significant marketshare, or will hardware-accelerated machine learning be consolidated such that application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are the preferred solution?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<strike><!-- more --></strike>

<p>The format is a 2-hour panel session with guests representing industry and academia. Each speaker will be given 10-15 minutes to briefly state their positions regarding the above questions. We will then open the floor to questions from the audience, which we expect to lead to engaging discussions.</p>

<p>We hope that by attending this workshop you will learn about new embedded applications that could benefit from the use of FPGA accelerated machine learning, as well as the technical challenges that need to be addressed in order to make this a reality. Furthermore, by gathering likeminded individuals, this workshop provides an opportunity to develop collaborations with panellists or other attendees.</p>

<p><strong>Speakers:</strong></p>

The work included Digital Video system design, HW –SW co-design, VLIW processor design and dedicated video processors. He was a visiting industrial fellow at Carnegie Mellon University, where he worked on early High Level Synthesis tools. He was a visiting industrial fellow at UC Berkeley where he worked on several models of computation and dataflow computing. He was a director of architecture at Trimedia, and CTO at Chameleon Systems. For more than a decade he is heading a team of researchers at Xilinx, including a significant part of the Xilinx European Laboratories. The research topics include next generation programming environments for processors and FPGA fabric, high-performance video systems, machine learning applications and architectures, wireless applications and new datacenter applications. He has been instrumental in the High-Level Synthesis technology and one of the technical leads in the novel ACAP technology. He is now a Fellow at Xilinx.</p>

architecture, high level synthesis, and machine learning. He is a member
of IEEE, IEICE, and IPSJ.</p>

<p><strong>Hiroki Nakahara</strong> received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in computer
science from Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan, in 2003,
2005, and 2007, respectively. He has held research/faculty positions at
Kyushu Institute of Technology, Iizuka, Japan, Kagoshima University,
Kagoshima, Japan, and Ehime University, Ehime, Japan. Now, he is an
associate professor at Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan. He was the
Workshop Chairman for the International Workshop on Post-Binary ULSI
Systems (ULSIWS) in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. He served
the Program Chairman for the International Symposium on 8th
Highly-Efficient Accelerators and Reconfigurable Technologies (HEART) in</p>
<ol>
  <li>He received the 8th IEEE/ACM MEMOCODE Design Contest 1st Place
Award in 2010, the SASIMI Outstanding Paper Award in 2010, IPSJ
Yamashita SIG Research Award in 2011, the 11st FIT Funai Best Paper
Award in 2012, the 7th IEEE MCSoC-13 Best Paper Award in 2013, and the
