<p>I was not able to find much information on how to program Australian repeaters into my Icom IC-2730A. I did this under a Windows 7 VirtualBox virtual machine since I thought all I needed was the Icom cloning software which is only available under Windows. Here is a list of steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Purchase (or make) an Icom OPC-478UC programming cable. These are about US$60 but I purchased a clone from ebay (<a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/3-5mm-USB-Programming-Cable-OPC-478U-ICOM-IC-F11-IC-F11S-IC-2200H-IC-2720H-Q2Q0-/252991340381">https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/3-5mm-USB-Programming-Cable-OPC-478U-ICOM-IC-F11-IC-F11S-IC-2200H-IC-2720H-Q2Q0-/252991340381</a>) for $5 Australian.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cable needs to be plugged into the right hand female port of the radio (looking from the back). It showed up as a Prolific Technology USB Serial Controller [0300] under VirtualBox so I installed the Windows 7 driver here  <a href="http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?p_id=225&amp;pcid=41">http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?p_id=225&amp;pcid=41</a>  after which Windows created a com port (com3).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Install the Icom cloning software <a href="https://www.icom.co.jp/world/support/download/firm/IC-2730A_E/1_00/">https://www.icom.co.jp/world/support/download/firm/IC-2730A_E/1_00/</a>. I thought I would be able to cut and paste the repeater list into this application but I couldn’t figure out how to do that …</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Install the Chirp software from <a href="https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home">https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obtain the WIA Australian repeater directory from <a href="http://www.wia.org.au/members/repeaters/data/">http://www.wia.org.au/members/repeaters/data/</a> (the “Example VBScript, Sorted Directory csv and CHIRP csv files and other csv formats” file) and unzip.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Chirp,
(a) download the radio data using the Radio -&gt; Download from radio menu
(b) File -&gt; Import the appropriate csv file from the chirp directory from (4). I used NSW\chirp_Sydney.csv
(c) It then gives you the option to select the repeaters you wish to import, I just clicked OK.
(d) Radio -&gt; Upload
(e) Switch radio off and on again</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I then cloned the radio using the Icom cloning software from (2) so I have an Icom icf file of my configuration.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
