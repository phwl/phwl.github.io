        "title": "Barramundi on Fly",
        "excerpt":"Introduction                       Barramundi        The Northern Territories (NT) of Australia is best known by fisherman for excellent barramundi fishing. The barramundi (or barra) can grow to enormous sizes (&gt; 100 lb), but anything over 1m is considered a trophy fish. Barramundi are much like the American bass, they hide around snags and ambush their prey. They can be caught in both fresh and saltwater although the saltwater barramundi are usually better to eat. The barramundi is one of the premier Australian sportfish as when hooked it will usually make several headshaking jumps several feet about the water. For its size, it does not have the line pulling ability of fish such as tarpon, but the spectacular jumps, its predator instincts and its delicious flesh make up for this.   Fishing for barra is usually using lures like the Nilsmaster invincibles and spearheads. Most fishermen change the trebles that come on these lures as they are a bit weak for a good barramundi. They are replaced with stronger rings and trebles.   Fishing is usually done by slow trolling and by casting at snags. Most fishing is done in small punts (12-14 ft) with 15 hp outboards. These boats allow you to go into the shallow water which the barramundi frequent and are easy to trailer along the rough dirt roads which lead to most boat ramps. Boat ramps are usually dirt and there is a huge advantage in having a small boat which you can physically haul into the water if required.   Bank fishing is generally not the best way of catching barra for two reasons. Firstly, there is a large risk of being eaten by a saltwater crocodile. The crocodile is a protected species and they are in almost plague proportions in most barramundi waters. The other reason that bank fishing is not as popular is that barramundi are spread throughout the river and the boat gives much more freedom of movement on the water.   On the Mary river at the Shady Camp wall, the fishing rules are very strict, single hooks only (no trebles) and a bag limit of 2 fish. The minimum size fish is 55 cm which means that any legal fish is quite big (approx 4 lb).   The bag limit is especially cunning as after you have caught your bag limit, you are not allowed to fish any more even if you will release all the fish you catch. Thus most anglers keep their first legal fish to ensure that they have something to eat and then release all other fish and hope that they can catch one right at the end.   The Story   The “wall” at Shady Camp on the Mary River is one place where barramundi can be caught from the shore. The wall is lot of rocks which drop about 1 meter. On the topside of the wall at any time of the day, a huge school of small tarpon (1-3 lb) are always splashing about. These are a fun diversion from the real business of barra fishing, but they are actually considered a rubbish fish and you can catch as many tarpon as you like there, every cast will get hit by at least one if not two tarpon. Anybody can easily catch a dozen tarpon in 30 minutes and I did this on an earlier visit to the wall. On light tackle such as a 6 wt fly rod, these tarpon put up a good fight, especially in the strong current that is present at the wall. The trick is to lead them out of this current once hooked.   For saltwater fly fishing, a reel which has a good drag is essential and my #8 wgt rod was ideal. I used an 8 wgt Cortland 444 weight forward floating line. To this was tied about 9 ft of 12 lb mono as a leader and then a 10 inch 40 lb shock tippet. In retrospect, I could have used 8 lb leader, but I didn’t have anything but 12 lb monofilament with me at the time. I probably would have broken my rod before I broke my leader.   The fly that I used was a “pink thing”. This is described in Lefty Kreh’s saltwater fly patterns and is a very effective barramundi fly. I went up to the NT with pink things, orange and black deceivers, dahlberg divers and poppers. At the “wall”, I found that I only needed to use pink things. These were tied on size 1 Tiemco saltwater hooks (I think it was 800S) which are excellent and well worth the extra money as they come out of the box very sharp and you don’t need to worry about sharpening them.   We arrived at the Shady Camp wall at approximately 3:30pm and were pleased to see that nobody was fishing the wall at this time. This allowed us to get into the best fishing positions.   The water forms rapids on the wall and dumps fast flowing churned up water into the bottom part. At the right time of year, barramundi are present in large numbers on both the top and bottom side of the wall. I feel that the best position is to stand in the fast water flow and fish the bottom part of the wall right in front of the edge of the rapid water. From this position, sight fishing to barramundi is possible as they can be seen in the water. This position allows one to fish both the fast flowing water and the slack water as well.   Within a minute or two of my first cast, I felt a bump. When fishing for barra, you often first feel a bump before the strike. This is the barra trying to stun its prey with its gill rakers. When the weight of the fish was felt, I stripped the line back hard and then sharply brought the rod tip to the air. Unlike trout, I was told to try to pull its head off to set the hook in the hard mouth. The rod buckled and I was on to my first barramundi of the afternoon. The barramundi jumped about 3 ft clear of the water and then charged downstream with the flow of the current. My reel screamed as I held the rod above my head and slowly moved towards the bank to fight the fish.   I could see when the barra jumped that it was a decent fish. The first run took about 3/4 of the fly line and I tried to ease it out of the fast current. After the first run, I managed to get back about 3/4 of the line it took before it made another half hearted run. Soon, it was about 30 ft away and it jumped out of the water again angrily. When the barramundi jumps from the water, it shakes its head and can often dislodge lures from its mouth. I think that it has a much harder time dislodging a fly. However, it is especially to keep the line tight at all stages. When the fish was about 20 ft away, I could see it on the surface exhausted. I grabbed the fish on the bottom jaw and lifted it from the water. It was a pretty good fish, about 6 lb and I promptly bled it to keep it for dinner. The fight took about 10 min from hookup.   I went back to my spot and then cast my line to the same spot that I had caught my first fish. Within two strips, I was on again. This one caught me by surprise, and I had fly line all tangled everywhere. Since I was standing in the fast current, you cannot leave the fly line on the water at your feet. A stripping basket would be handy but I prefer to hold the line in loops. I had a barramundi on one end pulling the line tight and I was trying to undo the knots that was formed on my other hand, at the same time trying to keep the rod tip high to stop the fish from snagging the line on rocks! It took me about a minute to fix my line and I was glad I had a strong 12 lb leader on which the fish was not able to pop. I fought the fish in a similar manner to the first one and landed a just legal barramundi. I let this one go without taking it out of the water since if I kept it, that would be my bag limit and I would have to stop fishing.   The next fish was caught with only a little more effort than the first fish, however, this was a 9 lb barra and this too was released even though that was the biggest barra I had caught so far on fly.   I tied on a new shock tippet as the old one was getting a bit worn and then I returned to my spot. After about half a dozen casts and retrieves, I was hooked up yet again. At first I thought that it was a small fish as I was able to pull the fish about 20 ft towards me. Then the fish made its first run. It quickly ran out all of my fly line and about the same again of backing before it stopped. I started pumping it in and it made another run of about 50 ft. At this point, the fish was about 200 ft away and I was worried that it may get caught on rocks in the middle of the river. I applied heavy side pressure and managed to coax it away from the rocks but without gaining any line. The fish never jumped and I fought the fish for what seemed like an eternity. I had backed off on my drag a little to make sure I would not lose the fish because of too much pressure and the backing to fly line knot must have gone though the guides two or three times. Slowly but surely the fish was coming in, and I had a small audience watching me at this stage. I was pumping the fish in and peering anxiously into the water to try to catch a glimpse of the size of the fish. About 10 runs later, I finally saw the fish, and to my disappointment, it was only small. When it reached the shore, I could see why. The fish had been foul hooked on a small flap of skin, just on the shoulder. I released the fish and returned again to the wall.   I caught a few more fish after that. About 30 minutes before sunset, too many people were crowding around me (all lure fishing with baitcasters) and they didn’t leave me enough room to cast properly. Since I had already caught a few fish, I decided to call it a day.   My friend who had been fishing the other side of the river soon came along with a fish the same size as mine. He had caught a few on a red Mr Twister. We cleaned the fish and left Shady Camp just before dark, having spent a little over two hours fishing.  ","categories": ["fishing"],

        "title": "Marlin on Fly",
        "excerpt":"Black marlin on fly, Cape Bowling Green, Queensland                        Black marlin        An edited version of this article appeared in (Australian) “Modern Fishing” magazine, April 1994, pp. 50-53.                          Warren, Tagging a black marlin, Cape Bowling Green, Queensland        It is hard to explain to the non-flyfisherman what we are actually trying to prove when we go saltwater flyfishing. The mechanics of casting, the long rods, the special flylines etc. seem to serve to make it as hard as possible to catch a given fish. The flyfisherman goes out fishing, gets outfished five to one by his mates using conventional gear, and goes away feeling superior. I don’t think I can explain why we do it, its just that when you catch a fish on a fly, the experience is so much more enjoyable.   One of my fishing ambitions was to catch a marlin on a fly. If saltwater flyfishing is an eccentric pursuit anyway, why not try to catch the most glamorous fish of them all?   To catch a marlin on a fly, there is only one place in Australia to go: Cape Bowling Green. These grounds, pioneered by Calvin Tilley, are arguably the world’s most prolific juvenile marlin waters, and 10 marlin a day is nothing unusual at Cape Bowling Green.   With the advice of Andrew Brzoz, proprietor of the Australian Fly Fisherman shop and the person who caught the first sailfish in Australia on a fly, we booked a 4 day charter on “Seaducer” through Angling Adventures. Andrew caught his sailfish from Seaducer and it was also the boat from which Jack Samson caught his black marlin which is described in his book, “Saltwater Fly Fishing”.   The trip was taken with my usual fishing mates, Ian Moore and Warren Monks. Ian was keen to flyfish whereas Warren would use conventional tackle.   After booking the trip, we had to organise our fly gear. We opted for Composite Developments 12-14 weight rods and Scientific Angler’s System II 12-13 reels. We were confident that the 12-13 reel would do the job, and it holds A LOT of line - about 400 yards of 30 lb backing, shooting line plus shooting head.   The fly of choice was a big white streamer with a tandem hook arrangement. We tied 8 of these on 4/0 hooks. These flies had a deerhair popping head and we prerigged them with a a 12 inch, 80lb Mason (hard type) shock tippet and a 10kg class tippet to form our fly/leader arrangement. We fished 10kg since it offered the advantage of being a new IGFA line class and not many record claims had been made. It also didn’t hurt to fish heavier leaders.   We finally got onboard Seaducer and met the captain, Calvin Tilley and deckhand Peter Reyne. It was a dark, windy day with a 1.5 meter swell. We reached Cape Bowling Green and started trolling deadbaits on conventional 6 kg tackle to get a feel for the fishing before we broke out the flyrods. This proved to be a pretty good formula and although we could have gone lighter, we did lose a few fish with broken lines etc.   The first thing we did was to stop on top of a bait school and get some livebait. Obtaining livies involved dropping a bait jig over the side, a couple of jerks, and winding in the jig, which by now would have a bait on each hook. In about five minutes, we had enough bait. The bait schools at Cape Bowling Green have to be seen to be believed. Some were about half a kilometer in diameter. Calvin said that they are sometimes kilometers in diameter!   In the first fifty meters of trolling, we had a hookup. Warren had no trouble landing it. It was a mack tuna. Warren was actually pretty happy with it, but Peter and Calvin looked at it in disgust, mumbling that it wasn’t a marlin.   By lunchtime, we had already caught 5 black marlin, all three of us having caught at least one. The marlin were about 50 to 70lb. In addition, we got two mack tuna and a spotted mackerel.   In the afternoon we started on fly. The procedure that we used was nearly exactly the same as that described in the Billy Pate video “Flyfishing for Billfish”. The marlin are teased up to the surface by trolling hookless teasers. On my first shot, the marlin actually took the fly, but I struck while it was still facing me and thus did not set the hook.   That evening, we practised casting by connecting a plastic milk bottle to the teaser rod and retrieving it as if it was a marlin. The person practising, would cast a fly to the “marlin” as it approached the boat. As we did this, a giant barracuda appeared from nowhere and smashed the milk bottle, completely crushing it. Warren, who was holding the rod, cast it out again and this time the barracuda took the milk bottle and raced away. For a few seconds he fought the barracuda until it finally let go of the milk bottle and swam away. As Calvin said, “There are so many fish out here you can catch them on milk bottles!”.   For the next four days, we tried and tried to get one on fly. We would troll at the unproductive times (and usually catch a few marlin) and then when the fish were on the bite (usually around the full tide), we would try the fly. We had about about sixteen shots up to the last afternoon of the charter and missed them all.   Some of the problems that we had were that the teasers were not cleared in time, we cast but the marlin didn’t seem interested in the fly, marlin ate the teaser etc. However, every shot was a new experience and every time was exciting. Imagine a fish about 50 to 80 lb charging up behind the boat to grab the teasers and then sight casting to it!   On the second day, Warren was fighting another mack tuna and suggested that I jump in the water and take some pictures of the fight from the water. Seconds after he finished this sentence, a huge blob appeared in the water. Warren pumped the fish in frantically, and the blob got bigger and bigger, and finally a huge whaler shark could be seen deep in the water. Dispite Warren’s efforts, the shark ate the estimated 25 lb tuna in one bite and disappeared.   Just after lunch on the last day, Peter suggested that we tie a different fly. The one that we were using wasn’t that visible and it was hard to smash it on the water with enough commotion that the marlin could hear the fly over the diesels and wake of the boat. We ended up tying the “mother” fly. I tied the fly with specifications given by Peter - “tie me the biggest ugliest fly you can”. To achieve this, I used half a pack of saddles on the rear hook and white, brown and grey deerhair on the front hook. The finished fly looked like a small bird and I had doubts as to what a marlin could possibly mistake it for. To this fly was added a big popping head which was white with pink candy strips and eyes. The resulting beast looked so ugly it had to work!   At about 2:30pm I saw a marlin come up on the teaser with its tail and dorsal fin sticking out of the water. “Marlin” I shouted and all of the crew rushed to bring in the other teasers. Peter teased the fish to about 30 ft from the back of the boat. “Are you ready?”, shouted Peter. “Ready”, I yelled and started my backcast as Calvin put the boat into neutral. I smashed the fly onto the water, in front of, and to the right of Mr Marlin. I gave it one twitch and the marlin turned and grabbed the fly. This was the perfect opportunity since the marlin was side on to me and I could set the hook into the side of the mouth. I struck once, twice, three times, then a fourth but nothing happened - the marlin must not have even felt it. Then, after hitting the fish five or six times, the marlin moved slowly away and I cleared my line. It accelerated, stripping off about 100 yards of line in a couple of seconds. It made the first of many jumps out at about 100 yards. After jumping a few more times, Calvin started backing the boat towards the fish and I wound frantically.   After a few more jumps, the marlin went down. Even on a game rod, if a marlin fights by going down deep, it can take half an hour to raise it. On a fly rod, it would be many times worse. Luckily, this marlin only went down about 40 feet and we could see it easily in the clear waters at Cape Bowling Green. I gradually fought it to the surface by continually changing the direction of pull. Calvin also positioned the boat to always be fighting the fish from a different angle. During the entire fight, Peter was giving me advice, and with their help, it gradually came to the surface.   My main problem at this stage was that my hands were covered with sweat and I was struggling to hold on to the rod, let alone fight the fish. I was holding the rod just under the first guide and pulling up as hard as I could. When the fish made a run or jump, the rod was quickly pointed at the fish so as to minimise the line tension. After about 15 minutes, the fish was about 8 foot from the back of the boat and Peter managed to tag it on the first attempt. Upon being tagged, the fish swam down again and it took another 5 minutes to bring it back up. It was brought to the side of the boat without too much drama and Peter grabbed it by the bill and lifted it onboard for a quick photo.   The fish was about 2.2 m and weighed an estimated 25 kg. After the photo, it was revived and then released. Congratulations were given all around and we had the whole afternoon to try to get one for Ian.   Ian had put on my “mother” fly and not long after, I heard Calvin shout “Fish”. Peter grabbed the teaser rod and Warren and I raced over and wound in the other teasers. In a few moments, I looked around and Ian was striking like a madman, the rod being loaded with a decent bend. The next second, the fish let go of the fly and it descended into the depths.   Unfortunately, although Ian had one final chance, it was not to be. I’m sure he will be back there to try again. In total, we caught 13 marlin and a sailfish, only one marlin falling to the fly. We had one double hookup with both fish landed. We did miss some greater than 70 lb black marlin on fly which we would have submitted for an IGFA 10 kg record claim, however, although this was always a possibility, we were not chasing records, but just trying to catch a marlin on fly.

The sun, like a billiard red ball, hung In the western sky: and the tireless tongue Of the wild-eyed man in the corner told This terrible tale of the days of old, And the party that ought to have kept the ducks.    ‘Well, it ain’t all joy bein’on the land With an overdraft that’d knock you flat; And the rabbits have pretty well took command; But the hardest thing for a man to stand Is the feller who says, “Well, I told you so! You should he’ done this way, don’t you know!” I could lay a bait for a man like that.   ‘The grasshoppers struck us in ninety-one And what they leave - well, it ain’t de luxe. But a growlin’ fault-findin’ son of a gun Who’d lent some money to stock our run - I said they’d eaten what grass we had - Says he, “Your management’s very bad, You had a right to have kept some ducks!”   ‘To have kept some ducks! And the place was white! Wherever you went you had to tread On grasshoppers guzzlin’ day and night; And when with a swoosh they rose in flight, If you didn’t look out for yourself they’d fly Like bullets into your open eye And knock it out of the back of your head.   ‘There isn’t a turkey or goose or swan, Or a duck that quacks, or a hen that clucks, Can make a difference on a run When a grasshopper plague has once begun; “If you’d finance us,” I says, “I’d buy Ten thousand emus and have a try; The job,” I says, “is too big for ducks!   “‘You must fetch a duck when you come to stay; A great big duck - a Muscovy toff Ready and fit,” I says, “for the fray; And if the grasshoppers come our way You turn your duck into the lucerne patch, And I’d be ready to make a match That the grasshoppers eats his feathers off!”   ‘He came to visit us by and by, And it just so happened one day in spring A kind of a cloud came over the sky - A wall of grasshoppers nine miles high, And nine miles thick, and nine hundred wide, Flyin’in regiments, side by side, And eatin’up every living thing.   ‘All day long, like a shower of rain, You’d hear ‘em smackin’ against the wall, Tap, tap, tap, on the window pane, And they’d rise and jump at the house again Till their crippled carcases piled outside. But what did it matter if thousands died - A million wouldn’t be missed at all.   ‘We were drinkin’ grasshoppers - so to speak Till we skimmed their carcases off the spring; And they fell so thick in the station creek They choked the waterholes all the week. There was scarcely room for a trout to rise, And they’d only take artificial flies - They got so sick of the real thing.   ‘An Arctic snowstorm was beat to rags When the hoppers rose for their morning flight With a flapping noise like a million flags: And the kitchen chimney was stuffed with bags For they’d fall right into the fire, and fry Till the cook sat down and began to cry And never a duck or a fowl in sight!   “We strolled across to the railroad track - Under a cover, beneath some trucks, I sees a feather and hears a quack; I stoops and I pulls the tarpaulin back - Every duck in the place was there, No good to them was the open air. “Mister,” I says, “There’s your blanky ducks!”’   by Banjo Patterson (1917)  ","categories": ["fishing"],

        "excerpt":"From Sydney, going trout fishing requires commitment. It is either an 8 hour drive to the Snowy Mountains or a plane trip to New Zealand. From Hong Kong, it is even more difficult. In London, I found out that the reservoir at Walthamstow is accessible by tube and stocked with trout. On the day, nobody was doing any catching at all. I thought that it would be a small puddle so I brought my pea shooter. Actually it was a large lake and everyone else was using heavy artillery to cast long distances.                                  Fly fisherman are friendly all over the world. I didn’t have the right flies but got chatting to a gentleman who seemed to have a lot of equipment but was not in a hurry to fish (I later found out that it was because he forgot to bring his rod). He was able to tell that I came from Australia from the knots I used. He showed me the British way of tying multiple flies on the leader and gave me a few of the correct flies (boobies and buzzers). I was kicking myself when I broke off a trout during a period when the fish were hard to fool. Nothing happened for a while, then suddenly, a school of about 5 fish swam past. I dropped a fly in front of it and caught a nice rainbow. Think I might go there regularly.   Walthamshow reminded me of an excellent novel, “Cloudstreet” by Tim Winton. It is about two families in Perth during and after the war. Here is an extract: “The river was broad and silvertopped and he knew its topography well enough to be out at night, though the old girl would have had a seizure at the thought. He never got bored with the landmarks, the swirls of barnacles and weed, the way the pelicans baulked and hovered like great baggy clowns. He liked to hear the skip of prawns and the way a confused school of mullet bucked and turned in a mob. From the river, you could be in the city but not on or of it.”   ","categories": ["fishing"],

        "title": "A trip to Finland",
        "excerpt":"My trip to Finland coincided with the Midsummer Festival, an event which I was lucky enough to share with my host Tero.                                                               The Festival coincides with the summer solstice, a time when the sun doesn’t set. It doesn’t rise in the east either, but rather does a little circle in the north. After a few days, I had completely lost track of time. In one case, I though was the afternoon whereas it was actually 10pm. Tero is a fishing fanatic and I was dragged to fly-fish for trout.                                                             It was hot and we only fished for a few hours in the middle of the day. Didn’t get any trout, but I caught this whopper on fly.                               It is traditional for Finns to light a bonfire on the Midsummer Festival and stay up all night drinking beer. Ours was started using petrol and although it was close to zero celcius, we couldn’t stand anywhere near it.                               The photo below was taken at 1:30am.                               At about 3am, we decided to go fishing using a funny contraption that is towed parallel to the boat. Several lures are attached (4 actually) and you around until a fish takes.                                                             Caught a pike using this method. Then they decided to head to an island for a walk.                                                            That was the end of a long day   Day 2   The next day we did a little more pike fishing.             After which we cooked them while we were cooking ourselves in the sauna.             I checked the fish trap and we had a great catch.             Then, back to fishing.                               Here I am demonstrating how to walk on water.              Day 3   We started the day by retrieving nets we had previously set. I always thought that nets would be a really efficient way to catch fish. What I didn’t realize is that untangling them was such a big job. There was one fish that took us about an hour to get out of the net. We ended up cutting it out without damaging the net, a job which required two people and I’m sure which is more difficult than performing a liver transplant.                               Then we went fishing.                                                                       Of course, the best part about fishing is that you can eat the fruits of your labour.                                That evening, we tried unsuccessfully to catch a pike on fly.   Day 4   By the final day, we had caught lots of fish. Tero had a conference call and I was left to my own devices, a potentially dangerous situation. Decided to go fly fishing and within 10 minutes, this little pike scoffed my fly, probably the first fly-caught pike from Tero’s lake.                               A few minutes later, I was trying to reposition the boat and noticed my fly line moving off to the side. Fly must have accidentally dropped out and the pike took it right next to the boat. Here is that unlucky fish.             Tero put on his lucky jumper and soon caught his own.             All in all, we had a great time fishing. We caught lots of fish, mainly pike but also perch, flatfish, pike-perch (zander) and sarki. I like pike, they are the ultimate predator with lightening speed, sharp teeth and the personality of a psychotic stepmother. You can often see them shoot out from the reeds and take your fly or lure. When they hit, there is no mistaking it. I look forward to catching a large one some day, they can grow to more than 40lb. Here is the successful fly and some of the lures that we used.                               ","categories": ["fishing"],

        "excerpt":"Forster is about a four hour drive from Sydney. Went on a very brief overnight camping/fishing trip with my good friends from Sydney University, Warren and Chris.                                Didn’t arrive until late in the afternoon but the conditions were almost perfect. We had packed Chris’ car to the limit with gear.                                Went straight to our spot.                                                             It wasn’t long before Warren caught the first tailor (note that hat, you have to be very self-confident to be seen in public in a hat like that).                                Others soon followed.                                                             After cleaning our fish in the dark (speed was more important than accuracy in this case), it was over to the National Park where we could cook and pitch our tent in absolute darkness. It was a beautiful moonless night, the type that makes you feel very small and insignificant in the grand scheme of things. We could see so many stars that some regions looked like clusters of clouds.                                                             The next morning was cold but there was a perfect mirror on the water beside which we camped.                                                             Made breakfast.                                                             Got some cunji for bait.                                                             and fished at the breakwall.                                In the evening, we fished the rocks again. This time I used cunji and pilchard pieces. Got a blackfish (also called luderick) on my first cast.                                Here is Chris with a tailor.                                                             We also caught some bream                                and here is the largest tailor we got, caught on a small spinning rod with 3kg line. The tailor jumped about 4 times and took about 10 min to land.                                Ended up with a nice mixed bag, we released some of the fish but also kept some for the table.                                                             Overall, had a great fishing trip with good friends. Life doesn’t get any better.                                ","categories": ["fishing"],

        "title": "Fishing, Renovating and Ballroom Dancing in Utah 2008",
        "excerpt":"Introduction   Some sections of the Green River in Utah have 22,000 trout per mile and it is arguably the best trout fishery in the US. When Prof Brent Nelson invited me to fish there it didn’t take me long to accept.                                  Salt Lake City (SLC) is a vast desert surrounded by the rocky mountains. At this time of year, there is still snow on most of the mountains and many higher altitude lakes are still frozen. It looked vaguely familiar and I could picture John Wayne coming down the mountain. What I found amazing was that anyone would settle in a place like SLC, coming over the mountains on wagons and just seeing miles and miles of featureless plains. They were definitely very tough people.         Upon arriving at Brent’s house, we got straight into renovating his bathroom. This was necessary as they wanted to use it during my visit. Academics are theorists and shouldn’t be allowed to do anything too practical. Yogi Berra said, “in theory there is no difference between theory and practice, in practice there is.” All of the bathroom’s electrical appliances worked properly except one set of lights. Also earlier, a large spark was inadvertently generated due to a short. After much bumbling around, we isolated the problem to a loose wire deep in the guts of the wiring. Quietly pleased that nobody got electrocuted, I helped Brent fix the rest of the bathroom, hang the door and everything was operational.   BYU and the Trip to the Green River   The next day, I gave a seminar at Brigham Young University (BYU). One of the best audiences I’ve spoken to, they asked very good questions about our work. Anyway, completed my talk without embarrassing myself too much and shortly after, we embarked on the 4 hour drive to the Green River.   On the way, we stopped at a 7-eleven. In the photo below, the small one on the left is a pint (600 ml) and the big one 1.9 L. I’ve seen 2 L bottles before but never a 2 L cup. Two of those are enough to kill you.      Here are some pictures that I took on the way to the Green River.                  That evening we walked the banks of the Green River. A large Osprey dive-bombed a trout right in front of us. It sounded like a bomb going off.   Here is a picture of where we stayed, we don’t get that much snow when we go skiing.      Green River   Didn’t sleep well that night, dreamt I lost my fishing rod. The next day we were at the Flaming Gorge boat ramp on the Green River. The weather was far from perfect. It was snowing, we had a force 10 gale and it was cold enough for the line to freeze in the guides. Even wearing all the clothes I brought (gloves, thermals, shirt, fleece and parka), I was still cold.   After a quick breakfast we met out guide, Ryan Kelly (www.greenriverflyfisher.com). He has the perfect life. In winter he is a skiing instructor and at other times he is a fishing guide. Utah has great skiing and hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics. Notable resorts include Sundance, Snowbird and Park City. Next time I’ll try them out, those mountains look scary, more sheer drops than ski slopes.   We put the boat in at Flaming Gorge Dam. Ryan remembered Brent because his eccentric brother-in-law hammered the trout using a crappie jig on a previous trip.      The river was crystal clear and we saw plenty of fish, sometimes twenty at a time. Started fishing a bobber (actually, fly-fishermen call them strike indicators) under which was had a sow bug and a zebra nymph. For those non-fishermen readers, a nymph is an underwater bug. Ryan made the (fishing) joke that we were nymphomanics. The morning started slow with the trout picking up the flies and then dropping them before.   Let me digress and discuss the mayfly which is key to trout fishing. It spends most of its life as a nymph on the bottom of a river. Trout eat lots of them so fly-fishermen use imitations fished underneath the surface of the water to catch them. When conditions are right, it rises to the surface and becomes a dun and then molts into a spinner.   The spinners mate, lay their eggs and die, hence the title of a book, “Sex, death and fly fishing”. All this happens within 24 hours, making it comparable to a Shakespearian tragedy.   Fly-fishermen spend lots of time waiting for conditions need to be right so the mayflies hatch in enormous numbers, causing the trout to throw their natural caution to the wind and go into a feeding frenzy. In this case, called a hatch, we fish what are called dry flies on the surface of the water, and the trout rise to take the flies.   Drifting is a beautiful way to fish as you want to present your flies so that they look like they are drifting naturally along with the current. Since the boat travels roughly the same speed as the flies, one can get really long drifts. After missing the first few, Brent caught the first trout and shortly after, I got this one.               We caught a few more before lunch and things picked up after lunch. We were soon catching a fish every cast.         Into the afternoon, the weather improved a little and there was a pretty good mayfly hatch (blue winged olives or BWOs to be more precise). We switched to tandem dry flies, a BWO and a cripple in a much large size than the natural and caught a lot more fish.   Much too soon the day was over. The fishing on the Green was better than anything else I had ever experienced. One might at first think that fishing the Green would be like shooting fish in a barrel, but the trout are very cautious in general and require some degree of finesse.   Ryan was a fantastic guide in all respects, a great fisherman, friendly and willing to give advice. He would often row upstream so we could fish the good drifts several times and always had the boat in the right position. He has the river completely wired and predicted everything that was going to happen before it actually did. His clients have never been skunked guiding on the Green, an amazing record considering the wide variety of abilities with which he must have to deal. If you ever fish the Green, I would highly recommend him.   Provo River   The next morning we were to fish the Provo River which only has 3000 fish per mile. This beautiful river is right next to Brent’s house and is smaller than the Green. We were expecting it to be a circus with lots people as it was a Saturday. It turned out that there were not very many at all but we later found that the highway leading in was closed due to a truck accident.   Again it was cold enough for our guides to ice up. We did not fish for long before Brent lost a nice brown trout and then almost immediately after caught another.         Adjusting my strike indicator, I snagged the bottom. I was trying to get it off for a while when it started to move! Fought the fish for a while but this battle ended up in a long distance release. However, a short time later, I caught this nice fat rainbow trout.            After lunch, we fished the upper Provo, expecting another mayfly hatch. Unfortunately, that day there were millions of people on the Upper Provo waiting for the same thing and we only saw a small number of trout even we had a really good hatch. We think the large number of people flogging the water scared the trout away.            On the way home, we went to Deer Creek Lake which had only recently had ice-off (we had considered fishing Strawberry Reservoir but it was still under a few feet of ice). There were huge rainbows there that people were catching on powerbait and we saw some patrolling the edges. Unfortunately, they weren’t too interested in the nymph I presented. I am still wondering what would have happened if I had fished a streamer on a sinking line.      That evening, I was taken kicking and screaming to a BYU ballroom dancing concert that Brent had to attend. It was pretty good but I think I prefer fishing.      Following the concert we played pool. Wanted to play all night but we were both tired.      In Search of Coffee   The next day was a Sunday and I took a bike ride all through Utah in search of a place to have a cup of coffee. Here are some pictures.                  Couldn’t find the pub though.   I had a wonderful time in Utah and look forward to returning. John Gierach put it best, “I don’t know what fly-fishing teaches us but I think it’s something we need to know.”  ","categories": ["fishing"],

        "excerpt":"Went on a 4 day fishing trip to Booti Booti National Park with my mates, Warren and Chris despite unfavourable tides and weather. Life’s too short to only go fishing when conditions are good. We went on a similar trip almost exactly a year ago.                                                             We first fished the rocks south of 7-mile beach. This is a particularly scenic spot and the Australian landscape presented itself in full glory on this clear winter’s day.   It wasn’t long before Warren was hooked up. Things are always exciting fishing off the rocks and it is touch and go with waves crashing all around. an angry fish on the other end of the line trying to break you off. Warren did a great job in landing the first fish of the trip. As a bonus, he retrieved an additional set of ganged hooks and pilchard from the fish!                                I don’t know the reason but sunsets are different in Australia than other places and I love to watch the colours turn from highly saturated to soft pastels.                                                             That evening we dipped our salmon fillets in flour and breadcrumbs and fried them. There is nothing like fresh fish eaten outdoors.                                One other simple pleasure is standing around a camp fire on a cold night and stare at the stars. We met a family having an extended camping trip in the park and they kindly invited us to share their fire. This is a 1 minute exposure with the fire in the foreground and stars up above.                                It was a really windy night and our tents were flapping around noisily making sleep near impossible. We really needed a hot drink while fishing the morning session.                                Back at camp, we had kookaburras for company.                                Took a drive to Wallis Lake and this pelican came over to check us out.                                Although we were fishing hard for salmon, better fishermen than us appeared in the form of a pod of more than 10 dolphins. They made fishing really tough the entire trip.                                                             The third day was very slow and I took time to repair an important piece of equipment, my sandals. I usually bring a Swiss Army knife and Leatherman tool and needed both to sew them back together with fishing line.                                I also noticed that my 25 year old tent is probably not waterproof any more. Time for a new one and lucky it didn’t rain. Here is a picture of the roof from the inside.                                Although there were about 10 people fishing the same beach, nobody was catching anything. Fortunately, the day was saved with this flathead, saving us from starvation.                                That evening our new friends lit a massive fire. Here is a group photo.                                The fire was really appreciated as it was very cold and windy. It was snowing nearby and that night I was cold even though I slept wearing all my clothes and fleece jacket.   On the final day, we ventured to the north part of the park. The wind was even stronger that day and we were sandblasted just standing on the beach. It was very beautiful there.                                                             Here you can see most of Seven Mile Beach.                                Warren caught the last salmon of the trip just as we were about to leave. After he had landed his fish and I took this photo, I put my cast right into the middle of the school. As I hung on, waiting for a take, a couple of dolphins chased them away!                                ","categories": ["fishing"],

        "title": "Life, the Universe and Fishing",
        "excerpt":"I was asked by Prof Evangeline Young to give a “Lunchtime Pizza talk” on the 15th May. Here is the text of the talk which is not really about fishing but concerns graduate research.                                  Introduction I started fishing rather late, at the age of 5. Although there are many things about my youth I cannot recall, I clearly remember my father taking me to our backyard, cutting down some bamboo, and then fashioning a fishing rod with some screws and bent nails being the additional pieces of hardware.  We went to a nearby estuary and I caught 5 fish. That was the beginning of my love of the sport.   Fly fishing involves using an artificial fly, usually made by wrapping fur, feathers and other materials around a hook, to catch a fish. We do not know when fly fishing originated but an Oxford scholar, William Radcliffe, attributes the first literary reference to a Roman poet, Martial, some time between 10 B.C. and 20 A.D. who wrote, “Who has not seen the scarus rise, decoyed and killed by fraudful flies.”   This beautiful quote explains what fly-fishing is all about.  In the first part of the sentence, “Who has not seen the scarus rise,” Martial refers to the habit of certain fish taking food in the form of insects from the surface of the water.  Fish can be fooled into rising to take an imitation or “decoy” in which a hook is hidden.   A major practical problem needs to be solved before we can pursue fly fishing, that is, how to cast a fly. In most other forms of casting, a heavy object is thrown with a fishing rod, pulling a light line behind it. Unfortunately, the flies that we wish to deliver are often only a few millimeters in length and weigh almost nothing so this technique will not work.  The way it is done in fly fishing is that a heavy “flyline” is cast using a rod. The weight of the flyline allows it to be delivered over a long distance and the fly is attached to the flyline via a thin, almost invisible nylon line.   Here is a typical scenario. Picture yourself in a crystal clear mountain stream. It is nearing dusk and a cloud of insects buzz around your head. You look into the water and see rings on the surface caused by a large brown trout quietly sipping insects from the surface. Dipping an aquarium net into the water, you collect some of the bugs which are floating with the current.  The insects are mayflies and you reach into your flybox and tie on a fly which is similar in size, shape and colour to the natural.   You carefully wade into the water and move into position. With heart pounding you take a deep breath to calm your nerves and cast upstream, making sure not to cast over the fish and spook it. The fly lands gently, about 10 feet above the fish, and drifts in the current toward the fish. The fish is completely fooled, lazily rises and takes your fly.   You strike with the rod and instantly it folds over, pulsing with life. The fish hesitates for a moment, not quite understanding what has happened. It then charges downstream and you take after it, hardly noticing the moss-covered rocks, trees and other obstacles in your way. You are racing to keep up with the fish and tension on the line but the fish is getting further and further away. You know this since your 100 ft fly line is all in the water. At a deep pool, the fish fortunately stops and you feel more in control as you gain back some of the line. It jumps and for the first time you understand just how big it is. It could even be over the 4.5~kg (10~lb) mark and will be larger than any trout you’ve ever caught.  It then makes a second run, this time upstream, securing its freedom by breaking the line. You are left trembling and looking stupidly at the slack line, replaying the event and wondering what you did wrong. This is fly-fishing and nobody who has ever had this experience would use the word “boring” to describe it.   For me, fishing is not just the action of walking to the nearest pool of water and dumping your line and hook in the water, it is an obsession. This essay is a random tour describing some of the things I learnt through fly fishing. It touches on many disciplines including biology, literature, poetry, art, physics, philosophy, religion, astronomy and, of course, cooking.   Gradual Improvement There are bigger fish, faster fish, ones which are easier or harder to catch, but none have received the same amount of attention as the trout. More has been written about this particular species of fish than about all others put together. Why? My contention is because it sometimes feeds on insects from the surface, thus making it a perfect target for fly fishing using dry flies, i.e. flies on the water’s surface.   Of course, a study of fishing involves understanding the fish itself. It has been said that 10% of the fishermen catch 90% of the fish. Like mathematics, playing tennis, learning a musical instrument or flying an aeroplane, one cannot expect to be good at it without a lot of practice. I am a believer in the theory that to become good at anything at all does not require a lot of talent but does need about 10,000 hours of practise.   At first, you are awkward and spend most of your fishing time untangling knots, retrieving your fly from trees and spooking fish. After a while you catch your first fish, an important milestone. You continue to learn from experienced fishermen who take the time to sit down with a stranger, explaining why they are successful and you are not. Often they make a present of their hand-tied flies or offer you a cup of coffee. You notice that they had the foresight to bring a spare cup. As you progress, you learn that the key to success is to curb your eagerness, slow down and approach the problem methodically.   Rather than think from the perspective of a human trying to catch a fish, you start to think like a fish and ask yourself where the prime spots in the river are located. These are places which offer both safety and easy access to food. You become better at reading rivers and lakes, being about to locate the deep holes and fast runs through the subtle cues that nature provides. You also think about where and when you should be fishing, the time of the day, the phase of the moon, the water level, weather etc. You learn that nearly everyone you see fishing in the middle of the day is doomed to failure since brown trout’s feeding habits are nocturnal. As one progresses even further, the pressure to catch lots of fish subsides, and you are happy just to be out fishing.   Nature In the fishing scenario described earlier, the mayfly was the source of food and, in fact, they have been described as the very foundation of the sport. The mayfly hatches from an egg at the bottom of the water in the form of a nymph which lives at the bottom of the water.  The nymphs feed on algae, diatoms, plankton and other material. The mayfly nymph spends about 95% of its life underwater, a period of 1 to 2 years. When it becomes mature, gasses collect in its outer shell and it floats to the surface and separates itself from its outer shell.  This process is called “emerging”.   The mayfly dun stage lasts from 1 to 4 days and the insects have upright wings which they must dry and strengthen before flight. When they are strong enough, the mayfly can fly and it rests and molts to become a spinner which is the last stage.   Mayfly spinners live only for a day which is kind of sad.  Male and female spinners mate and the males die straight away. The females, more hardworking than the males, have one final mission to complete before they die, that is to lay their eggs.  The more one experiences and studies this remarkable process, the more profound it appears, and in fact, hundreds of books have been written about this subject.   Fly fishermen spend lots of time waiting for conditions to be just right. When they are, the mayflies hatch in enormous numbers, causing the trout to throw their natural caution to the wind and go into a feeding frenzy. This happens just often enough to keep a fisherman interested, but not so often that it can ever be counted on.   Even when a massive hatch of mayflies occurs and the trout are rising all over the river to them, it doesn’t mean that you will catch a fish. If there are thousands of natural insects on the water, why should the trout take a fly? As I’m sure one can appreciate, the fly is only a caricature of the natural and does look different. Fishing through an enormous hatch with fish rising furiously everywhere and not getting a single fish to even look at your fly is a sobering experience. At the point you think those fish are impossible to catch, you’ll see a trout confidently take a cigarette butt.   Outdoors Obsessed as many fly fishermen are, there are many attractions to the sport apart from just the fishing part. Trout live in mountainous regions with clean, cool running water and lots of vegetation in and around the water to supply food. I have been fortunate to fish for trout in locations such as Australia, New Zealand, Italy and the US. Just being outdoors, solving the big or little problems that are bound to arise in any extended trip and to work with, rather than against the forces of nature has taught me a lot.   I have camped in places far from civilization during the new moon when it was so dark that you cannot see your hand in front of your eyes. If you look up, you can see the vastness of the entire universe. Instead of individual stars, you see clouds of white and you realize how insignificant we are in the grand scheme of things.   I believe that the best fishing is to be experienced a long way from the city in places with difficult access that requires long walks and overnight stays to get there.  Such places have less fishing pressure and are more beautiful. Although most fly fishermen I know practice catch and release, keeping one or two for dinner is fine, although it should be done humanely and with a slightly guilty conscience.   An excellent way to prepare trout is to wrap it in foil with some onion, tomato and lemon slices. Add some salt, paper and olive oil and cook for about 20 minutes in the ashes of a fire. The foil serves to keep in the juices and the fish is kept moist in this process. A fresh wild trout caught far from civilization, prepared in this manner and eaten outdoors is always a memorable meal. Such a meal after a successful day of fishing is just as much a highlight of a trip as catching the fish itself.   People have fished as a means of survival as far back as we can trace history and fishing tools date back about 40,000 years ago.  Of course, in those times, fishing was a means of survival. However, even in those days I believe that, of an evening after a particularly good session, the men sat around the fire boasting about their fishing prowess and the one that got away.   Literature There are more than 11,000 books being sold at Amazon on fishing and more than 3,000 on fly fishing. There are specialized books on entomology, fishing locations, fly tying, fishing tactics, fishing photography, casting etc. One can find books just on mayflies, knots or rod building. I have a lot more books on fishing than I do on computer science.   One of my favourite books is “A River Runs through It.” It is an autobiographical short story written by Norman McClean, an English professor, which was later made into a film by Robert Redford in 1992.   The first few sentences are as follows, “In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing. We lived at the junction of great trout rivers in western Montana, and our father was a Presbyterian minister and a fly fisherman who tied his own flies and taught others. He told us about Christ’s disciples being fishermen, and we were left to assume, as my brother and I did, that all first-class fishermen on the Sea of Galilee were fly fishermen and that John, the favorite, was a dry-fly fisherman.”   The Australian poet, Banjo Patterson, wrote “A Ballad of Ducks” which describes a grasshopper plague. Here is a verse, “We were drinkin’ grasshoppers—so to speak –  Till we skimmed their carcasses off the spring;  And they fell so thick in the station creek  They choked the waterholes all the week.  There was scarcely room for a trout to rise,  And they’d only take artificial flies –  They got so sick of the real thing.”   The Future Man’s status at the top of the food chain can be ascribed to our ability to develop tools and techniques to solve practical problems.  I am pessimistic about the future of fly fishing as it is through our intelligence that we have the ability to completely exhaust fish stocks through overfishing and environmental damage. Fishing groups have lobbied governments for improved management of fisheries and there are many success stories of potentially damaging projects being stopped by such efforts. Unfortunately, in the name of progress, more and more such projects are being proposed and it appears to me that money usually trumps fishing or the environment in the long term. I believe we should do more to stop the deterioration of our planet and promote sustainable fisheries for future generations.   Conclusion I have learnt many things through fishing and find that being successful in fishing has many similarities with being a good researcher. Irrespective of whether you ask me how to be a good researcher or a good fisherman, I would give the following suggestions: 1.    Fish fertile waters. One of the important things in fishing is being at the right place at the right time. If you do the wrong thing, you will not be successful. In your research, try to learn what is productive and what is not. 2.    Learn from others. Don’t be afraid to ask people things, most would be very flattered to be asked, you will learn faster and even make new friends. 3.    Be persistent, life is not meant to be easy. I have caught a marlin using a fly. It would have been a world record had it been claimed and was taken on the last cast of a 3 day trip. I was not a particularly good fisherman at the time and believe I was rewarded. You should really believe in what you do and work 100% to achieve it. 4.    Strive to improve. Learn to be content with what you achieve, learn from your mistakes and work actively to improve. 5.    Slow down and think before you act. Myself and many others spend too much time working rather than thinking. The latter is harder to do but unfortunately good research cannot be achieved through hard work alone. Inspiration has often come to me only when I have had the time to think and question what I am doing. This has often been while fishing. 6.    Do what you are interested in and aim high. You can only excel at something you are interested in. Pursue your interests, work hard and you will be very surprised at what you can achieve.   I end with a quote from Henry David Thoreau who described it perfectly when he wrote, “Many men go fishing all of their lives without knowing that it is not fish they are after.”  ","categories": ["academia"],

The Ottawa River defines the border and in the photograph below, Ontario is on the left and Quebec on the right.   Their parliament was built in Victorian times in a gothic style and the buildings are beautiful. Here is another panorama with parliament in the foreground and Quebec across the river.                                Canadians are generally very nice people but out on the ice hockey rink they show their true colours. In hockey, fighting is encouraged and it is sort of like kendo on ice. The other popular sport is curling which looks about as much fun as mowing the lawn. It was so boring I didn’t watch it long enough to see a fight.   The world’s longest skating rink at 8km in length is formed in Rideau canal. I’m told that students skate between Ottawa University and Carleton University to attend their classes.                                While skating, they like to eat their own version of fried dough (“you tiao”) called “beaver tail” which I tried at “Beavertails”.                                Eating outside in the freezing cold is never a good idea but even taking that into consideration, the beaver tail tasted about as good as it looks in the photo i.e. absolutely terrible.

Our boat is now 20 years old and starting to be looking a bit old and tired (I didn’t know aluminium could rust). Before we could go, we had to do a few things including installing a new sounder, filling the holes from the old one and fixing the trailer.      This being the Christmas period, the boat ramp was absolutely packed with people, boats and pelicans.      The first job was to pump saltwater pink nippers from a nearby sandflat.      (photo below from http://www.dreamfish.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=57:how-to-catch-nippers-saltwater-yabbies&amp;catid=34:fishing-articles&amp;Itemid=54)      To get to the fishing location you pass by Milsons Passage. Nice place to have a holiday house but a bit inconvenient since you can only get there by boat. At any time, about half of them are for sale.      Around the corner and you are in the middle of nowhere.      Caught a fish for dinner      and then we had to find a camping spot, pitch our tents and get some firewood. Had steaks and pan fried bream for dinner.            Got out early the following morning. For the first few hours we didn’t do very well but then got into some fish. The next hour was one of those times where you catch a fish every cast.      I wish they wouldn’t allow trawlers to fish the Hawkesbury.      For dinner, we had fresh fish and baked potatoes cooked on the coals.         That evening we had a perfectly clear night. Part of the Orion constellation appears near the bottom of the photo.      This was a 1 minute exposure, taken on the beach at our campsite.      Next day was a clear, sunny day. We knew where to go and got straight into more fish. Here is Warren hooked up.      Another fish      Our fishing spot was also the runway for float planes.      By mid-morning we had enough in the keeper net and decided to call it a day.      A crowded boat ramp at Mooney Mooney.      That was the end of a wonderful fishing trip. Only thing left to do was to clean the day’s catch, boat, outboard, rods, reels, cutlery, pots, …         Bream steamed with shallots and ginger.

        "excerpt":"In what has turned out to become an annual event, went on a 4 day camping trip to the Hawkesbury River with my high-school friend, Warren. We camp on a beach which is only accessible by boat.                                                               This year, someone had erected a very handy table.                                Oysters are available by our campsite.                                We saw this brush turkey at the boat ramp. I resisted the temptation of bagging it for Christmas dinner.                                This year, we only had to share it with this monitor lizard which went through all our rubbish and also stole some of our fish.                                                             During the night, we saw this owl take a mouse from a few meters away.                                There were more jellyfish this year than we have ever seen. I didn’t get a photo but one morning there were hundreds on the surface of the water.                                Apart from the wildlife, we had some excellent fishing. Caught a shovel nose shark (but didn’t take a photo) as well as several large stingrays from the beach. They stingrays put up a great fight.                                                             We released the largest flathead.                                                             as well as this tailor.                                This jewfish, however, was barbecued.                                Keeper net keeps the fish alive while we are fishing.                                A couple of beam for lunch.                                A non-seafood dinner with T-bone steaks, onions, and sweet corn wrapped in foil.                                I had another wonderful trip, and the Hawkesbury River is only 30 min from home. However, this fisherman was unloading bream from a fish trap, and trawlers go through the area every day. This leaves me to wonder whether commercial fishing in the area is absolutely necessary. Banning of commercial fishing as they have done in Sydney Harbour, would certainly result in improved fish stocks and ensure the long term sustainability of this special place.

        "title": "Lake Eucumbene 2013",
        "excerpt":"Lake Eucumbene is an alpine lake about 500km south west of Sydney. My fishing mate, Beard (nickname which refered to his facial hair - he doesn’t have one anymore but the name stuck), and I made a trip down there to fish with former fly-fishing guide and Eucumbene guru, Steve.                                  We camped at Buckenderra Holiday Village, situated at the bottom end of the lake. According to Steve, fishing has been exceptional in the last few years because new ground was flooded every year. Unfortunately, when we were there, the lake was low and weather conditions extremely hot (35 degrees celsius, 95 fahrenheit). Fishing was not good and no fish were caught the night before.                                                            The first evening saw us fishing in a location only accessible by 4 wheel drive. We had 6 anglers (myself, Beard, Steve and 3 of Steve’s friends) in two cars. Conditions seemed good as it was hot and humid, with lots of bugs hatching, particularly midges. Lots of dragonfly nymph shells could be found on the shore. In fact, they were so good I wished that I had not left the insect repellant in the car.   Here is a photo of Steve fishing at sunset.   &lt;a href=     \"/assets/images/2013/01/P1040414.jpg\" &gt;   &lt;img src=    \"/assets/images/2013/01/P1040414.jpg\"  alt=\"\"&gt;    &lt;figcaption&gt;     &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   I was fishing an Alexandra (shown below) because it is a beautiful fly and has a history. It was invented in 1860 and originally called the “Lady of the Lake”. It was later renamed in honour of Princess Alexandra of Denmark who married Edward VII in 1863. In the old days, it was so effective that there was talk of banning this fly.   &lt;a href=     \"/assets/images/2013/01/P1050458.jpg\" &gt;   &lt;img src=    \"/assets/images/2013/01/P1050458.jpg\"  alt=\"\"&gt;    &lt;figcaption&gt;     &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   All evening, I was fishing badly, catching my fly on nearly every object in front and behind. The fishing was tough with very few fish rising, and those that did were well outside fly-casting range.   After a long period of time, a trout rose directly in front of me and I was able to cover it with a cast. I started a slow retrieve (which is very difficult to do when a fish is nearby). It took the fly and the rod buckled over. The fish then promptly wrapped my 4lb tippet around a nearby snag protruding from the water. I was able to wade out to it and, using my feet, lift the unlucky trout out of the water and bring it back to shore.                                It was a reasonably nice rainbow trout, and had a clipped fin. It was autopsied and we found it to not be particularly fully, and its diet to have been midge pupae. We were later able to identify the fish as being a 4 year old from its fin as they clip the right and left pectoral and dorsal fins according to year. Shortly after catching my fish, Steve got a similar sized wild rainbow, which had midge pupae and a bloodworm in its stomach. Then the fishing shut down and no more fish were caught, as it turns out, for the rest of the trip.   The next morning we were up at 5:30am to fish Middlingbank. Fished all morning without seeing a single rise. Two guys in a boat were catching some fish trolling though.                                Here is a photograph of Beard casting.                                The following morning, we went out in Steve’s boat. This was a real treat for us and it is a beautiful bass boat which was imported from the US and not very common in Australia. Although we tried a number of really good looking spots, the only thing that happened in 4 hours of fishing was that a trout took and spat out my fly while I was fiddling with my camera.                                Although we were hoping to do better than a single fish in three solid days of fishing, we were rather lucky to catch any at all given the difficult conditions. Lake Eucumbene is a beautiful and tranquil place, and I hope to return soon. It is particularly special to me as I caught my first trout on fly here under Steve’s guidance 20 years ago.  ","categories": ["fishing"],

        "title": "Postcard from Harbin",
        "excerpt":"Had a really cool time in Harbin.                                  This was the view from my departing flight,                                and this was the view arriving in Harbin.                                                             Needless to say, they are very different cities.   My hosts, Prof Yu Peng and Dr Shaojun Wang kindly arranged for Basin Wang and Rigui Yi, both postgraduate students at Harbin Institute of Technology to take me out on fantastic Lantern Festival day. They were very nice to me, despite being forced to listen to 8 hours of my lectures.   We first visited the Siberia Tiger Park which was amazing, particularly since Siberian Tigers are a seriously endangered species. We took a bus ride through the park, from which we could get really close to the animals.                                While most of them were reddish-yellow in color, we saw a couple of white ones.                                After the bus ride, we walked around a caged area.                               This keeper was preparing live chickens for feeding.                                I know that the tigers are thinking, “it’s KFC time”. I wonder what the chicken is thinking?                                We had lunch at Longhua Yucun Restaurant.                                These were just kept as pets and not on the menu.                               A really large wok.                                This photo is with Haomiao Wang and Rigui Yi. The tables in this restaurant were designed like boats. I am thinking of redecorating our kitchen in the same style.    &lt;a href=     \"/assets/images/2013/02/P2241373.jpg\" &gt;   &lt;img src=    \"/assets/images/2013/02/P2241373.jpg\"  alt=\"\"&gt;    &lt;figcaption&gt;     &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   This is the Songhua River. There is a sign which says “No swimming”. I strongly doubt you could do that even if you wanted to.                                Next we visited the Harbin Sun Island International Snow Sculpture Art Expo, where there were snow sculptures on display. It is a very lovely park and some of the sculptures were really impressive. The best way to describe it to Sydneysiders is that it is sort of like Sculpture by the Sea, except it is really cold and there is no sea even though it is on an island.                                This one is Beethoven.                               The Songhua River with Harbin in the background.                               Of course, the main attraction is the Harbin Snow and Ice Festival.                                                            It wasn’t long before the temperature dropped to -20 C.                               This is the “Angry birds” area.                               I was very impressed by the display.                               Just as were were about to leave, they put on some Lantern Day fireworks.                               Following dinner at the Boteman Xi Canting Restaurant where we had Russian food, we walked to the Songhua River where people were sending up hot air balloons fueled with candles.                               All the orange dots in the air are lanterns. It was a very beautiful sight and I wish I was able to get a better photo.                               I was so tired the following day, I didn’t feel like playing tennis.                                This is the student canteen. They have food from many different provinces. The food is good and very inexpensive.                               For example a fried sauce noodle zhajiangmian with spring onion pancake costs 8 RMB.                               I had a fantastic time due to the wonderful hospitality of my hosts, Prof Yu Peng, Dr Shaojun Wang, Dr Liu Datong, Yeyong Pang and Jianbo Zhou.                                Profs Qian-fan Zhang and Liguo Wang.                               I was treated to some wonderful meals as can be seen below.                                                                                                                       Things went pear-shaped on my return journey. Heavy snow was forecast for just after my departure and, of course, my flight was delayed. The snow fell so hard I couldn’t see the planes from inside the terminal. Amazingly, the runway was operational about 10 minutes after the snow stopped, and there was still hope to make the flight. Our China Southern plane then had some other mechanical problem and we arrived in Shanghai and hour after my Qantas flight had departed. This was the first time I had ever missed a connection.   The guy at the gate didn’t particularly want to help me, and I was hot under the collar because: (1)  I was tired and (2) the long underwear I was still wearing as not appropriate for Shanghai. I tried to put pressure on him by writing down his name, Shi Xi Sheng. When I got to the ticketing counter I noticed the girl there had the same name! Guess they got a bulk deal on those name tags. Since Qantas was closed for the day, all they could do is arrange a hotel room.  I later found out the name means “occupational trainee”.   To cut a long story short, I did manage to get the last seat on the flight back to Sydney the next day, which, incidentally was filled with students returning for first semester. The person sitting behind me knew me as he was a student in our School. Anyway, the extra day in Shanghai wasn’t a total loss, I was able to have crab roe xiao long bao.                               I’ll finish with a travel tip for those not terribly familiar with China. Most hotels have free wired ethernet but no wifi. If you bring something like this TP-Link TL-MR3020 Wireless N Router, you can turn it into a wifi hotspot and connect your phone etc. This is particularly useful if you either don’t bring a laptop or, like me, have a machine with no ethernet.

Chen Shuai kindly accompanied me to visit the former residence of Soong Ching Ling, Sun Yat-sen’s wife (we also went to Sun Yat-sen’s former residence but that was not as interesting).                                Soong Ching Ling was someone I greatly admire, She had friends like Stalin, who gave her this car.                                This was one of her favourite books.

        "title": "High Altitude Balloon Launch #1",
        "excerpt":"Our Sydney University Electrical Engineering students, Stephen Tridgell and David Portelli successfully made a high-altitude balloon launch from Blayney, NSW. Stephen’s report is after the jump.                                  Excellent job guys!                                                                                                                                                                                   Balloon Launch Report (by Stephen Tridgell)   On the 11th of May a Balloon with approximately a 2Kg payload was launched from Blayney Tourist Park. The balloon contained:           A Find Me Spot GPS Tracker            A HTC smart phone            A Go Pro 2 Camera            An Arduino Uno board            A high current output stage            Nichrome wire            A Radar Reflector constructed of aluminium foil and cardboard            A Small parachute            A Medipack Heat warmer       Regulations:   In order to meet CASA approval we were required to have the following:           A method of popping the balloon from the ground            A suitable launch site far away from any flight paths            That it be fitted with a radar reflector            That the personnel launching the balloon must be contactable during its flight       Design of the Balloon:   To meet these requirements a radar reflector was constructed out of aluminum foil and cardboard. The chosen method of popping the balloon was to use nichrome wire around the balloons neck and if necessary heat up the wire by putting a large current through it to melt the neck of the balloon. In order to achieve this an Arduino Board was used with a output stage capable of drawing large current. The Arduino board would be triggered via bluetooth from the HTC phone when it received a message. There would also be an independent GPS tracker and a Camera to take scenic photos.   Construction of the Balloon System:   The balloon was constructed over a few weeks which was mostly focused on enclosing all the items securely in a box. The chosen method for this was to drill holes in the box and tie down the components with cable ties. A small piece of plywood was also used to secure the Go Pro camera to the box. It was theorized that the box would get quite cold when the balloon achieved sufficient altitude. To attempt to combat this, a heat Medipack was attached to the lid of the box. In order for the box to be successfully communicated with a python Script was developed to run on the HTC phone with a corresponding Bluetooth program running on the Arduino Uno. On the Uno it was necessary to use four digital pins in order to sink sufficient current into the board so that the current over the Nichrome wire would be high enough to pop the balloon. There was some experimentation and it was found that the wire required around 2 to 2.5 Amps to heat up enough to pop the balloon. Fishing line was selected as the means of holding the box, parachute, radar reflector and balloon together as it is high strength. There was a limited amount that could be done until right before the launch as all the components in the box were battery powered and hence could not be securely fastened until they had been activated.   Issues before the Launch:   The launch team arrived at the site a 1pm, which was about an hour later than expected. Setting up all the equipment ready for launch also took longer than expected resulting in a launch at around 15:30.  One issue was that many things needed to be done just before the launch such as:           GPS set up to Track            Aduino Uno On and connected to the output Stage            Phone on and Connected via Bluetooth to the Uno            Go Pro Camera set to take Photos every 2 Secs            Medi Heat Pack activated            Sealing the box            Filling up the balloon with helium       Additionally, the first time the balloon wasn’t filled up enough resulting in a very anti-climatic launch. The balloon had to be detached, filled a little more and reattached to the payload. For this payload the balloon required 3.5 m^3 of helium at 1atm.   Issues After Launch:   Immediately after launch the balloon was observed to be swinging the payload rather vigorously.  Fortunately the payload was securely fastened and the fishing line did not break. The balloon was tracked visually initially and was heading south. The first GPS tracking point confirmed this, however after the tracking point at 15:40 the GPS did not send a tracking point until 16:40 which was at its final resting place. The loss of GPS means we cannot map its trajectory which was a little disappointing. From the camera evidence it can be gathered that it took approximately 40 minutes to reach the peak after launch and 20 minutes to come back down. The first image after launch was judged to be at around 20m, This implies an initial vertical velocity of around 10m/s. Extrapolating this to the average speed of the upwards flight this implies it reached a maximum height of 79 000 feet. This is consistent with the images obtained as a height of around this is necessary to see the curvature of the earth. As it took only 20 minutes to come down, it was calculated that the balloon probably hit the ground at 70-75 km/hour. This is a lot faster than expected and is possibly due to the parachute getting tangled on the way down. The likely reason for this appears to be the balloon which, after popping was still attached to the rest of the balloon. The speed at which it came down is an issue that needs to be improved upon in future launches as it could cause significant damage. There will have to be design improvements and possibly a larger parachute or a smaller payload.   Issues with the Recovery:   As the balloon was launched late, the recovery started late too. The prediction had showed a position far to the east, thus after launch the team made their way to Bathurst. The first point at the landing sight was detected at 16:40 however it was mistakenly hypothesized that this was simply a point while it was still in the air as the predicted flight time was a lot longer than an hour and a lot further. When it was eventually realized there were several scattered GPS locations and the team made their way to the landing site. They reached it at around 18:00, after dark. The numerous GPS positions meant that there was a reasonable area that it could have landed in and the landing site, though near a dirt road had a few barbed wire fences and other obstacles. The balloon was not found the night it landed, due to uncertainty in the accuracy of the GPS and lack of light. In order for it to be found more easily in the future, it is recommended that the balloon be fitted with a buzzer and a flashing light. This would enable it to be more reliably and quickly recovered. It was found the next day to be very close to a few of the GPS points so it is believed that the accuracy is fairly good but there were a few points on the map far from where it was found. It can be seen from the landing site and the picture prior to landing that the balloon hit a tree and came to rest on the ground.   Summary:   The launch was a success as the balloon reached a high altitude took fantastic pictures and was recovered successfully. There were a few areas for improvement as there could have been issues with the launch. The highest priority one is a larger or better parachute deployment as it came down far too fast, which could not only damage the equipment but could harm someone or a third parties property. The launch timing needed to be planned better so that it could be recovered before dark. Possibly a more accurate GPS or one that could work at higher altitude.   ","categories": ["photography"],

        "excerpt":"After a superb trip to Harbin in winter, I returned in summer to attend the ICEMI conference, kindly hosted again by Prof Peng Yu, Prof Shaojun Wang and Mr Yeyong Pang from Harbin Institute of Technology.   This is the view from Dragon Tower.   &lt;a href=     \"/assets/images/2013/08/P8193616.jpg\" &gt;   &lt;img src=    \"/assets/images/2013/08/P8193616.jpg\"  alt=\"\"&gt;    &lt;figcaption&gt;     &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   and an 11MB, 30-shot 360 degree panorama of Harbin.                                  The difference could not be greater. In February, the Songhua River where the guy below is swimming was frozen solid.                                Sun Island is where they had the International Snow Sculpture Art Festival. We fed the fish.                                As well as the deer.                                View from behind a waterfall.   &lt;a href=     \"/assets/images/2013/08/P8153123.jpg\" &gt;   &lt;img src=    \"/assets/images/2013/08/P8153123.jpg\"  alt=\"\"&gt;    &lt;figcaption&gt;     &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   Songhua River at Sun Island.                                Siberian Tiger Park.                                                             Here are some shop workers doing a dance before work. In the background you can see both Chinese and Russian signs, unique to Harbin.   &lt;a href=     \"/assets/images/2013/08/P8163181.jpg\" &gt;   &lt;img src=    \"/assets/images/2013/08/P8163181.jpg\"  alt=\"\"&gt;    &lt;figcaption&gt;     &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   This photo shows a number of contrasts between old and new.   &lt;a href=     \"/assets/images/2013/08/P8193595.jpg\" &gt;   &lt;img src=    \"/assets/images/2013/08/P8193595.jpg\"  alt=\"\"&gt;    &lt;figcaption&gt;     &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   People burning stuff for good luck during the Hungry Ghost Festival.   &lt;a href=     \"/assets/images/2013/08/P8203759.jpg\" &gt;   &lt;img src=    \"/assets/images/2013/08/P8203759.jpg\"  alt=\"\"&gt;    &lt;figcaption&gt;     &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   We then took a long trip (about 6 hours by car each direction) to Jinpo Lake, and walked through the Underground Forest which is at the bottom of a volcano crater.    &lt;a href=     \"/assets/images/2013/08/P8213813.jpg\" &gt;   &lt;img src=    \"/assets/images/2013/08/P8213813.jpg\"  alt=\"\"&gt;    &lt;figcaption&gt;     &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   Diaoshuilou Falls. According to the sign, it is “the world’s largest lava air-hole collapse-type waterfall” (whatever that means). Anyway, it was spectcular.    &lt;a href=     \"/assets/images/2013/08/P8223887.jpg\" &gt;   &lt;img src=    \"/assets/images/2013/08/P8223887.jpg\"  alt=\"\"&gt;    &lt;figcaption&gt;     &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   I was also impressed by the beauty of the countryside. Here is a photo taken from the car. The crops in the foreground are rice and corn.                                I had a wonderful trip due to the hospitality of my hosts. They will be visiting Sydney in October, and I hope that we can make their visit as enjoyable as mine.   ","categories": ["travel"],

        "title": "Postcard from Kyoto and Osaka",
        "excerpt":"Following the International Conference on Field Programmable Technology we spent some time in Kyoto and Osaka.                                Clear Water Temple is a World Heritage Site. Here are some schoolgirls playing with water.              Prayer cards.                                Nice hat.             This is Clear Water Temple itself, with a view of Kyoto in the background. Built in 1633, it is a magnificent piece of carpentry.              Massive pieces of timber were used and lots of fancy joints.              This picture is actually quite misleading as autumn was long over.             We then took the bus to nearby Gion.                                Many tourists enjoy dressing up in kimonos and taking selfies.                                Japanese marbled beef restaurant.              The Shinto Fushimi Inari Shrine with many torii gates.              Of all the places we visited, I was most impressed by Nijo Castle and its surrounding gardens.                         A serious mortise and tenon.             Nishiki market.              A simple breakfast.              Japanese knives are only ground on one side (chisel grind) and hence are either left or right handed. This was part of the left handed offerings.              Sharpening bench.             Not sure if he is applying his maker’s stamp here.             We then went to a ryokan on Lake Biwa, the largest freshwater lake in Japan,             and played camping.             A private spa in the ryokan.             A bit of a feast with Japanese marbled beef, sashimi and crab.             Following the visit to Lake Biwa, we went to Kyoto station and took the train to Osaka.                        Pedestrians have to share the pavement with cyclists.             A professional hitman with his wife.             In Osaka, it is easy to tell which restaurants specialise in what food.              Didn’t try this.              Noodle bar.             Overall, we had a great time in Kyoto and Osaka. This was the first time I’ve been there and I would definitely not pass up an opportunity to return.  ","categories": ["travel"],

        "title": "Hawkesbury River 2013",
        "excerpt":"Our trips to the Hawkesbury River have become an annual event.        As usual, the boat ramp was at capacity.                                Went overboard with supplies, not much room for the passengers.                                Warren at the campsite.                                Campfire on the first night.                                Bandicoot hole, we saw it after dark but didn’t get a photograph.   &lt;a href=     \"/assets/images/2013/12/PC2843781.jpg\" &gt;   &lt;img src=    \"/assets/images/2013/12/PC2843781.jpg\"  alt=\"\"&gt;    &lt;figcaption&gt;     &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   Cicada wing. The cicadas were really noisy and like an alarm clock set for the crack of dawn. Other insect life included ticks from which I received two bites.   &lt;a href=     \"/assets/images/2013/12/PC2843941.jpg\" &gt;   &lt;img src=    \"/assets/images/2013/12/PC2843941.jpg\"  alt=\"\"&gt;    &lt;figcaption&gt;     &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   These were baked in foil for dinner on the first night.      This trip, we had exceptional flathead fishing.                                The biggest was around 50 cm.   &lt;a href=     \"/assets/images/2013/12/PC2844131.jpg\" &gt;   &lt;img src=    \"/assets/images/2013/12/PC2844131.jpg\"  alt=\"\"&gt;    &lt;figcaption&gt;     &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   Mulloway just short of the 45 cm minimum.                                On the way to the boat ramp at 6am to collect Barry for a day of fishing, our outboard started playing up and we had to restart about 10 times. Fortunately, we guessed that it was due to contaminated petrol and with a new tank, we were soon on our way. Unfortunately, that day, gale force winds were in place and the fishing was quiet. Fortunately, Barry managed to get this flattie.   &lt;a href=     \"/assets/images/2013/12/PC294417.jpg\" &gt;   &lt;img src=    \"/assets/images/2013/12/PC294417.jpg\"  alt=\"\"&gt;    &lt;figcaption&gt;     &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   Warren had the brilliant idea of putting the food in his tent so that animals wouldn’t take it in the middle of the night. Something (probably a monitor lizard), made a hole in his tent and munched through half a loaf of bread. This photo shows the field repair in progress.   &lt;a href=     \"/assets/images/2013/12/PC294423.jpg\" &gt;   &lt;img src=    \"/assets/images/2013/12/PC294423.jpg\"  alt=\"\"&gt;    &lt;figcaption&gt;     &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   Another enjoyable trip but nothing really that wasn’t covered previously. Although most of our catch were flathead, we also caught bream, mulloway, catfish and a stingray.   Our outboard is an Evinrude E30RLETA from 1993, still works beautifully but back at Warren’s place, we broke the outboard’s swivel bracket - another problem to fix!  ","categories": ["fishing"],

        "excerpt":"   Left Sydney in the last week of November 2014 for London.     Australia’s contribution to fashion is the Ugg boot. Strangely, among all the boutiques in Knightsbridge, this was the only shop where people were queuing.      My hotel room was upgraded to a Superior Room. The photograph below shows both walls. The cupboard on the right hand side is so small that my jacket doesn’t fit entirely within (actually the coat hanger doesn’t fit either).      A hat shop in Convent Garden. Need to get a deerstalker some day.                                Sweet shop.      Also in Covent Garden.      Foyle’s is my favourite London bookshop. The new renovation is superb.                                I met this guy inside Foyles. Unfortunately, you can’t tell the size from this photo but it was huge.      Cafe Nero in South Kensington.                                   Gangster having breakfast.      Inside the Victoria and Albert Museum.      Went to mass at the Brompton Oratory (where everything but the sermon was in Latin).      Gave a talk at Bristol University. I had thought Bristol would be a hick town with one general store and petrol station but it is a beautiful city.      This is the Bristol Museum. They made these planes there in the early days of aviation.                                Then it was to Hong Kong, their airport has a similar plane on display.                                This is the approach to Pudong Airport, Shanghai.                                Shanghai at night.                                   The banquet at the International Conference on Field Programmable Technology was a cruise.                                Near Fudan University (Pudong Zhangjiang campus).                                We went to the Shanghai antiques market on Dongtai road.      This Oba-mao t-shirt was popular.                                Lunch at a noodle bar.                                Stayed near the Shanghai Railway Station.

A colleague brought the geekiest bottle of wine you’ve ever seen to dinner.      A packed train.      Newly renovated Page One bookstore in Tsim Sha Tsui.      Government housing museum.      Consumerism gone wild. I thought all these people with rolling luggage were on their way to the airport but actually it is to carry their shopping.      Of course, we had many wonderful meals.   Mock shark’s fin.                                Pigeon.                                Chinese lamb casserole.                                Peking duck.

        "excerpt":"                             Waited for ages for my beloved wife’s bag then got that sinking feeling when the carousel stops turning. Everyone had gone and only a small purple bag with a pink ribbon remained. Went to the service counter and filled in all the forms for missing luggage. We flew the budget airline Jetstar, if the bag was not found within 24 hours, we’d get a total of $40 to cover expenses - wow. About to take off in the rental car when they called me and said they found the bag. Someone (presumably the owner of the purple bag), had mistakenly taken our black bag which was a totally different size and make. Anyway, things were looking better.   I had booked at hotel in Bronte Park which was a few hours drive. There was enough time to get there before dark. The GPS didn’t quite match my paper map (wouldn’t go without a backup), but we gave it the benefit of the doubt until we ended but in the same spot about an hour later.   At about 7pm, the sealed road turned into gravel just as it started raining. Slowed down to about 50 km/h (30 miles per hour) as I didn’t want to hit anything but as I rounded a corner a wombat ran out, I swerved to avoid it but clipped it with my front left hand side. Backed up to the wombat which was trying to crawl off the road with only its front feet working. I had no choice but to put it out of its misery. Damage was a cracked front bumper bar and two plastic protective pieces under the car. Lucky there was nothing except cosmetic damage to the car, it would have been a bad place to break down with no cell phone coverage and cars going by every 15 minutes or so.   We stayed they night at Bronte Park Village, which is primarily a fishing destination. I can’t think of any other reason why someone would go there. There are four main lakes in the vicinity, Bronte Lagoon, Bradys Lake, Lake Binney and Tungatinah Lagoon. It was a typical one shop village, with the central attraction being the general store and service station.                                                             The next day was a fine day and we passed through some nice scenery between Bronte Park and Cradle Mountain.                                                             We had lunch in the major town of Deloraine. The photo below shows the busiest part of the main street that day.                                Deloraine is by the Meander River, a name which I find rather interesting.                                We also stopped to pick up some strawberries at Sheffield Berry Gardens.                                                                                          The drive ended up taking most of the day and we didn’t arrive until the late afternoon at the Cradle Mountain Wilderness Village. We would be roughing it for a couple of days.                                                                                          Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair national park is part of the Tasmanian Wildnerness World Heritage Area which covers 20% of Tasmania and is 15,800 square kilometers in area.Cradle Mountain gets its distinctive shape from its Jurassic dolerite columns and is 1545m above sea level. The area below, including Dove Lake, was carved by glacial processes.   It is truly unspoilt and although Cradle Mountain is a premier tourist destination, it is well managed with shuttle services reducing traffic in the park, toilets, strict limits on how many vehicles can be inside the park at any time, and well maintained walking tracks. We walked the Dove Lake Circuit, about a 6 km walk around the lake.                                                                                                                                                                                 We went back in the evening to take some photos at dusk.                                                                                                                                                    We also met a couple of girls who were about to talk the Overland Track. This is a 6 day 65 km walk (although someone ran it in 7 hours 25 minutes) from Cradle Mountain to Lake St Clair.  There are huts along the way. You can normally tell the experience of a hiker by the condition of their packs. In the case of the girls, they were brand new so I hope they know what they are doing.   Our final days were in Hobart. We stayed at the Wrest Point Casino which doesn’t have a 13th floor.                                                                                          Lots of mussels and oysters growing just outside the hotel.                                They have lots of good food in Hobart, particularly seafood and steak.                                                             Spent the rest of the time sightseeing, most interesting was the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. Lots to see there including this 500 year old Huon Pine slice                                and this Tasmanian native bark canoe.                                Overall our 5 days in Tasmania, particularly Cradle Mountain was too short. We certainly intend to return.  ","categories": ["travel"],

There was the time Beard, Warren and myself tried to run a rapid on the Katherine River in the Northern Territories in a triple kayak, went upside down and Warren had a treble embedded in his foot, but fortunately it had been debarbed. There was also the time I was fishing by myself and had a hook embedded down to the barb in my tongue (long story), but I managed to get it out without much damage.

A new coffee shop appeared which is pretty good.                                Streets of Harbin.      Of course, Chinese cuisine is the first choice.                                            I have a favourite dumpling restaurant in Harbin, near HIT.      Apart from excellent dumplings, it is worthwhile just for the translations.         Visited the Siberian Tiger Park again which is always amazing.

The other choice was a Quintrex 420SC Renegade which is nearly the same boat. One of the reasons I chose the Outlaw is it is a little deeper.      I really like the 3mm top and bottom aluminum,  clean layout and the side console. It is quite a bit heavier than the old boat and hence gives a much better ride in the chop. There is lots of room for storage in the front casting deck, and a live-bait tank in the rear. Will give more details of the boat as it is customised. Richard at http://www.mystaceroutlaw449.com gives good information on what he did with his Stacer Outlaw 449.   This is the first fish caught.

        "title": "New Zealand Fly-Fishing 2015",
        "excerpt":"After attending the International Conference on Field Programmable Technology, Brent, Ken and myself took a 5-day fly-fishing trip around the Omarama region of the South Island in New Zealand. We called this the 1st FPGA Fly-Fishing Symposium (FFF’15). Last time I was there was Nov 1996, before web browers and digital cameras! I had previously fished with Brent in Utah.                                                             We rented a Nissan Sunny with 200,000 kilometres on the odo and bits and pieces falling off, e.g. there were only two hubcaps, it did about 20L per 100 km, the fuel opening latch didn’t work, bald tyres, steering was twitchy, and the inside boot opening latch didn’t work (more about that later). When Ken got the car, the rental place specifically said that scratching the car was ok but they preferred that we did’t dent it any further.                                                                                          Stayed at the Omarama Top 10 Holiday Park which had very helpful signage.                                It wasn’t long before we went fishing in Lake Benmore. This is me with a brown trout                                and here is Brent catching a fine brown.                                                             This is Ken and I crossing the Ahuriri River. The road bridge is in the background.                                Ken fishing to a trout which can be seen to the right of his fly line.                                A trout in shallow water.                                Ken had caught plenty of salmon fly-fishing in Seattle, but the following sequence shows his first ever brown trout.                                                                                          Promotional photo for Brent and Ken’s upcoming fly-fishing TV show.                                Throughout the trip we had fine cuisine.                                                                        Here I am netting my largest brown trout of the trip.                               These wild flowers are called lupins and were in full bloom.                                Lower Ahuriri River.             Brent in a selfie with an Ahuriri rainbow.                               Another Ahuriri River brown.                                Where the Ahuriri River meets Lake Benmore.                                                             Rainbow trout.                                Ken casting on the Tekapo River.                                                             Took a break from fishing to visit the Salmon Ponds salmon farm.                               Brent hooked up to a salmon.                                Ohau Canal - it really is this colour. There are supposed to be 20 kg brown trout in here but we didn’t get a touch.                                Cows with Mount Cook in background (I think).                               Upper Ahuriri River.                                On the way to the airport, at a remote fishing location, we locked the car keys in the boot. That was a really bad move as the inside boot opening latch was broken. We tried with one person throwing the inside switch while the other pushed up and down on the boot but that didn’t work. Tried accessing the boot from the back seat but there was a big case in the way and we couldn’t reach it. In a last desperate attempt, we tried jiggling the opener while pushing up and down on the boot again. It opened!   Lost items included my hat which got blown into the river. Ken left a set of haemostats on the river bank but found them the next day. The worst was Brent who broke a rod (a new Orvis but they will replace it for a nominal fee), lost a new Orvis reel (which was found by the caravan park and will be returned), dropped a pair of haemostats in the lake, and lost a set of line clippers.   Flies which worked best were mainly brown and black nymphs, particularly bead-heads, pheasant tails and hare’s ears. All were size 8-12 and we were mostly fishing with strike indicators, even in shallow backwaters. We had a rule that a fish caught with a bow-and-arrow cast counted double, nobody was able to do so although I did cast to two fish this way.   The fishing was not as great as it could have been. We had 50-100 km/h wind gusts more than half the time and once while trying to cast forwards it blew so hard the fly ended up behind me. Moreover, the river was discoloured making sight fishing difficult. Despite that, we caught some really nice fish and everything was done with good humour. Overall it was a marvellous trip.

The rig involves a green weed or sea lettuce on a size 8 hook below a quill float which is carefully balanced with a few split shot. A 10 ft whippy rod and sidecast reel makes up the tackle needed for this type of fishing. Beard called me up the day before to see if I wanted to go fishing, so we made a plan to meet the next day.                                  Before long had one on the rocks.                                Then there was plenty of action with these two resulting from a double hookup (one of two double hookups for the day).

        "excerpt":"Spent a week in Osaka, the last time we were there was 2013.        Shuttle ride to Sydney airport.                                Had a day to check out the Monet exhibition at the Hong Kong Heritage Museum.                                                             The guy in the foreground is engraving someone’s name at the Aritsugu knife shop in Nishiki Market, Kyoto. The guy in the middle is sharpening knives and I’m not sure what the lady is doing. This knife shop is one of the oldest in Japan, having been founded in 1560 (of course, the shop has not been in the market for that long). I think the sword market isn’t what it used to be so they moved to knives.                                Went to listen to the Japanese jazz singer Yuko Usui at Jazz On Top.                                Made a day trip to Nara. Very impressive woodwork and carving in the Todai-ji Temple.                                                             Pity the lady didn’t get stuck inside.                                Deer harassing a shopkeeper.                                                             Trying to convince my wife we need a sharpening station like this in the kitchen.                                We stayed near Umeda station.                                                                                                                       Then of course, a lot of food eaten. Here are a few of our favourites.

Wasabi at Nishiki market.                                A light dinner from the Hanshin department store food hall.                                Went to Kobe to try Kobe beef at the Ishida Restaurant.                                                             Tried the grade A4 and A5 Kobe beef there.

        "title": "Olympic Peninsula Fly-Fishing 2016",
        "excerpt":"I participated in the 2nd FPGA Fly-Fishing (FFF’16) Symposium in Seattle WA, hosted by Ken and attended by Guy, Aaron (not pictured below) and myself. The previous FFF was in New Zealand and is described here http://phwl.org/new-zealand-fly-fishing-2015/.       DAY 0   The Olympic Peninsula lies across Puget Sound from Seattle, WA.         Flew with Guy from San Jose to Seattle-Tacoma, arriving at 9pm. Aaron picked us up and we hurried to Fred Meyer (a huge, city-like supermarket) near the airport to buy fishing licenses. After some difficulty (the girl didn’t know what to do with someone that didn’t have a social security number), we purchased our $40 3 day licenses. Then a 2 hour drive to Diamond Point near Sequim. We were also surprised by Ken presenting us with a conference gift, the FFF landing net.                                Before we arrrived, Ken caught a sea run cutthroat. He also saw up close, but didn’t hook a coho. He originally thought it was an early-stage male chum, but more likely a very advanced-age male coho. This fish pulled tight but didn’t get hooked as Ken had a bent-over hook point, likely damaged while casting.   He also got a jack blackmouth and spooked another at Port Williams.   **DAY 1 **   At 6:30am the next morning fished Diamond Point beach . Lots of birds around but only saw 1 or 2 dives. Also saw sea otters, a few seals and a sea lion. Fished along the shore up to the cottage using a green and white deceiver.      Upon walking in the water I realised my 10 year old waders were leaking. The fact that the tape was coming off in all places should have been a clue.      It was a very beautiful place and an overcast morning. Unfortunately, for the rest of the trip, we had really nice weather which was the opposite of what we would prefer for good fishing.      We next went to Port Whitney where Ken had caught a cutthroat trout and lost a chum salmon the night before. Guy got hit by what I think was a cutthroat and I saw a few rises, some close in and some far away. Unfortunately nobody caught anything.   Had lunch at the 101 Brewery, the type of diner you would walk in wearing waders without comment.                                      In an effort to fit in, I had something not available down under, the “Timberman Grilled Beef”: roast beef, green pepper, mushroom, onion and cheddar melted on a hoagie roll (which was excellent).                                In the afternoon we fished the Quilcene River. Upon arriving at 2pm, a group that was spinning came out with 4 nice cohos. The water was a bit fast and there weren’t many places to fish. Drifted a few flies but didn’t catch anything.      In the evening we returned to Port Whitney. I think I was getting a bit tired by then as I tied a second tippet onto my tippet and had to take it off. Guy took a crab on his spinning tackle which was promptly disqualified since it was not caught using fly gear. We saw 2 bald eagles fishing far offshore as we left.      Ken was primarily fishing a green with black stripes “foul-free herring” in the saltwater. Although this is a good cutthroat and a reasonable coho fly, he was primarily fishing it on the mistaken belief that there were chum in the area as well. He was using an intermediate sink tip with sinking leader in the rivers.   DAY 2 The next morning we fished the Dungeness River.         Ken caught a 12lb spawned out coho in a backwater. We didn’t get a photo but here is a dead one.      We saw 3 more fish there but spooked them. Fishing other parts was not successful.            After lunch at Hardy’s Market we went to the Dungeness River and Ken caught a small 14” coho which was the first fish that we kept.            He then hooked another, slightly smaller fish just further down the same run. As soon as its head came out of the water the fish spit the hook.   In the evening, fished the Port Williams beach without any success although Ken saw lots of fish including 1 decent coho jumping full-body out of the water.      That night we had Ken’s coho, along with Dungeness crab cakes with mango salsa, and shrimps cook  ed over a coal bbq. It was a wonderful meal, with all the ingredients having been caught by his in-laws and frozen. Best crab cakes I’ve tasted! His in-laws were mad keen fishermen and lots of great fishing stories were told, although everyone was skeptical when I brought up solunar theory and asserted that fish tend to congregate under power lines.            Two days into a two and a half day trip I hadn’t had a single touch even though we had fished from 7:30am to dusk every day. Explaining that I didn’t like to peak too early, our plan for the last day was to go out really early, arriving at the place that Ken had caught today’s keeper right before sunrise.   DAY 3 Arrived at the carpark of the Dungeness River near mouth at 0630 and it was still pitch dark. The carpark wasn’t open so Ken kindly stayed at the carpark while we walked in and fished. I had changed to a sinking leader but didn’t get a touch in a couple of hours. Ken lined a fish and spooked him strongly (almost the entire tail cleared the water as he quickly turned downstream just beside Ken’s sinking leader). This was a much sadder event, since he must not have seen or liked the fly that Ken had drifted over him 2 to 4 times just prior. Guy was at a slow, shallow pool and saw a dozen fish swim by over the course of the morning.         At this point Guy and Aaron had to leave. We decided to fish one last place which was upriver, under the power lines. This was a 1 km hike in and not far from the car, the soles of my 10 year old wading boots separated from the upper. Fortunately I could still wear them like a slipper but it didn’t help with wading in fast water.      On the way in, I spoke to a fisherman with a spinning rod coming out. He said he didn’t have a touch all morning.      Fished a few slow pools and a couple of faster ones. The last pool before giving up looked good so I covered it very slowly but not a touch. As a final resort, I changed my fly to a heavier black wooly bugger. Reworking the same pool, I was surprised to get hit straight away in the spot where the fish should have been, right behind a large boulder, shielded from the flow. A short fight on 12lb tippet material showed I had a nice bull trout, a member of the salmon family known as char.   After some photos and a celebratory handshake, this endangered native fish was released. I learned that Ken had taken a ~8” bull trout about 5 minutes earlier on a mildly weighted purple and black “egg-sucking leech”.   I fished the same run and a bit lower down, got another tap but didn’t hook up. On the next cast, I received another tap but the fish had bitten off my fly. I had made a classic beginner’s mistake of not retying a possibly weakened tippet after catching the fish. Who knows whether or not that was a huge coho!      Epilogue   It was a wonderful trip and I learnt a lot, in particular that there is such a thing as electric wading boot dryers and Ken’s diy conversion into wader-dryers.      On my return trip, there was an issue at San Francisco airport so I took a 150 mile ride from Seattle to Vancouver in a propellor plane to connect to Sydney. I think they call it the “puddle jumper”.      Thanks particularly to Ken but also to Guy and Aaron for a wonderful trip!   ","categories": ["fishing"],

        "title": "Trinity River 2017",
        "excerpt":"The 3rd annual FPGA Fly Fishing Workshop (FFF’17) was down on attendance, only Ken and myself participating from the 19-20th Feb, 2017. This year, it was on the Trinity River, California, fishing for steelhead (sea run rainbow trout). These are a reasonably hard fish to catch, one fish being a good result. Arrived at about 10am at SFO and was met by Ken at the airport.                                     The FFF’17 conference gift.                                After renting a car, we had to plan where to go fishing. We had initially wanted to try the Yuba River and Feather River, but the Yuba got blown out because of 9 inches of rain in a week and also the Oroville Dam was about to explode and had to let water out. There was talk of evacuating some towns.   We decided on the Trinity River if a hotel could be found. Rang the Old Lewiston Inn but there was no answer. Started the drive anyway and went to get fishing licenses at the only place that sold them, a Walmart just outside of Sacramento. By the time we got there, a complete plan had emerged. The Inn called and confirmed a vacancy. This allowed a call to The Fly Shop to arrange a guide (this was all done inside Walmart). Purchased our fishing license and then celebrated with lunch at In and Out.             On the 4 hour drive to Lewiston, the road was flooded to a degree that traffic was backed up for several miles. Fortunately we were using Google Maps, which took us on a detour, saving at least an hour. We did drive through pretty deep water though.                                   Got to The Fly Shop at 1720, not long before its closing at 1800. Seeing the logo there, Ken realised he knew about it through their catalog that he had at home. The guys there were very helpful and even gave us each a nice poster sized map of the region.                                      Had dinner at the Lewiston Hotel where they had country AND western music. The ribs were great.             The next morning at 8am, met our guide, Mike Parker and after launching the boat under the bridge new the Old Lewiston and doing a shuttle to the pull out point, we were fishing at 9am. It was cold and raining. At the launch place, a group of local pot growers (really) put in just ahead of us.                                   Mike mentioned that he went to Rush Creek the previous day and saw about 20 something fish rise to mayflies before the sun came out and killed it.                                Our rig was as follows. Amnesia line loop 3 ft to tippet material to a 3ft bobber to split shot then swivel, 18 inches to a pegged pink bead then hook 2 inches behind, to the shank of the hook is 1 ft to a big bead head rubber legged stonefly, 18 inches to 3-4 inches of globug yarn clinch knotted to tippet, then a bare hook, 3 or 4 inches behind.      At 10:30am I hooked a nice brown trout and landed it without too much drama.                                At 11am Ken caught his first steelhead on fly and the first fish using a strike indicator.                                    At lunch, it was cold and raining. We saw another boat and notice a fish rising in front of their boat. Then we noticed a lot of mayflies on the water. We went back up and Ken, after a number of casts, managed to hook the fish on an #18 Adams. Unfortunately, it came off a few seconds later because it swam towards him.       Nothing happened for a few more hours, until 3:30pm when I hooked a fish and lost it a second later. We drifted the same spot about 8 times, Mike calls it “Commitment” and I noticed my split shot had fallen off. The next after after putting a new one on, we hooked a steelhead in the same spot as the previous fish. This one was wrapped tightly with three hooks set in its body and couldn’t swim. We netted the fish but unfortunately I dropped it in the water before we got a good photo. We estimated it at about 28” and 9lb. This is the best photograph.                                    We retrieved the boat at Steel Bridge.   I went on about the solunar tables but neither of my uneducated boat mates believed me. Following the trip, we found the minor time to be 1040-1240, which was the period when we caught 2 of our 3 fish. Coincidence? I think not.   Throughout the day, we missed plenty of fish, maybe a dozen good strikes, felt the fish on about half a dozen occasions and boated 3. This was actually a good outcome because often, either no touches or a couple of possible hits are all your get when steelhead fishing.   Mike was a great guide, with lots of entertaining stories and we learned a lot from him. He is highly recommended and we hope to have the privilege of fishing with him again in the future. It was a magnificent and memorable day.   The next day, we fished on foot. Had a tough day including Ken turning a 4 piece rod into a 5 piece and some people in a raft stopping and moving right in on our spot. As we were about to give up, we decided to change tactics from nymphs to dry flies. There was a mayfly hatch going on at the time with swallows swooping around to feed on them. Ken saved the day by catching his first fish, a small hatchery steelhead, on a self-tied dry fly (sorry for the fuzzy photo, he dropped it in the water before I could get a better one).                                The day after the workshop, in San Jose, Ken literally hit a fork on the road, resulting in a flat tyre. Although a large amount of time was wasted, it is funny that he was disabled by cutlery.                                ","categories": ["fishing"],

Dear Phil, our group of four people boarded Brain’s chart boat (big boat licensed for 15- standard package of 8 person) at Jerseyville, South West Rocks. We had one Aussie, two Swedish men and me. Here is a photo of us at 6am this morning.

Boat traveled along the coast line to near grassy head adjacent to continent shelf with water depth ~30m.                                Live slimy mackerel was very effective. In 10 minutes we managed to catch our 1st big mackerel and within one hour we caught average 3 mackerel each. We lost a couple as well. One Swedish guy took a little long time fish getting it in, this resulting in a “haircut” by a shark!

I have written about my previous trips to Shanghai in 2014, 2013 and 2012.                                  Left Sydney on Good Friday.                                As usual, we stayed at Fudan University, Zhangjiang Campus.      Expert building.      On the first day we went to the Qibao Ancient Town from the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1126) and situated on the Puhui River.                                                             Hip lady.      In the evening we visited the famous Peace Hotel, used by the Gang of Four during the Cultural Revolution and the location for a number of movies.   We tried unsuccessfully to enter the renowned Jazz Bar.      On Easter Sunday, we went to the Huxinting Teahouse in Yuyuen Garden. This was the first teahouse in China and has been there since 1955. Previous visitors include the Queen. Entry is via a zig-zag bridge which is supposed to protect it from evil spirits. The crowd was almost enough to keep me out, but once inside it was very pleasant.      Inside the tea house.   Old lady and grand daughter.      West lake longjing tea.      View from the window.   Outside there were people making jewellery.                                Lady in traditional dress.                                Bored people on the subway.   Dinner with students from Fudan.                                A prototype of the new Apple bike.      On the last evening, we tried unsuccessfully to enter the renowned Cotton Club jazz bar. Unfortunately, the place went out of business.      Of course there was plenty to eat in Shanghai.   On the first evening we had a wonderful dinner on the top floor of the Henderson Metropolitan.         Longjing and chrysanthemum tea.      Malantou.      BBQ spare ribs.      Braised eel.      Vegetables with crab roe.      Xiaolongbao.      Spicy beef noodles.                               Burrito.                                Soup dumplings.                                Handmade noodles from Fudan’s canteen.      Red bean pancake.      I will end with a travel tip. This was the first time I travelled with my own beans, grinder and coffee maker to avoid having to scour the city for a decent coffee shop. I think I’ll continue to do this in the future (unless going to Italy).     ","categories": ["travel"],

In this case the installation goes smoothly but when you reboot the installed system, you get a “No working init” error.       The best way to do it is:       Insert your usb and determine device using       diskutil list   In my case it was /dev/disk2      Unmount using       diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2       (BE CAREFUL YOU GET THE DISK NUMBER RIGHT IN THIS STEP) Assuming the ubuntu iso file is XX.iso, write to usb using       sudo dd if=XX.iso of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=4m   ","categories": ["software"],

        "title": "Fly-fishing for Kingfish in Pittwater, Sydney",
        "excerpt":"Ken came from Seattle to Sydney for a few solid days of fishing. I’m going to call this FFF’18 (even though it was in 2017 and the real FFF’18 was Ken and Guy fishing in NZ).                                  Day 1 Hawkesbury River   On the first day, Nicole and I took him out on the boat to the Hawkesbury River to fish Bar Point. It was a pretty quiet day and we fished all the usual spots with no success. When we moved close to shore at The Point, we caught and released his first fish, a Soapy.                                We caught a couple more soapies after which I hooked up on something different. I was surprised that it was a really nice &gt; 40cm whiting, which is a personal best for me.                                Next Ken caught the target specices, a bream but it was a little too small.                                Back at the boat ramp, we were literally attacked by pelicans, trying to snatch our fish. Nicole took this photo under great pressure.                                Day 2 Pittwater with Justin Duggan   The main purpose of the trip was for Ken and I to learn how to fly-fish for kingfish. We enlisted Justin Duggan, Sydney Flyfishing, who picked us up from Newport Wharf.                                                             This furball is an Enrico Puglasi Flex Calamari fly (looks more convincing when wet), and what we used for Kingfish on the surface. It wasn’t long before we saw some surface kingfish activity. Justin teased the fish towards the boat with a skipbait lure (no hooks) and we sight cast to a pack of kingfish with no result.                                It wasn’t long before Ken hooked up and landed this beautiful kingfish. He looks happy in this photo.                                Here are a couple of photos courtesy of Justin.                                                             Soon after, Ken caught another and then we had a double hookup. Mine didn’t fight much as it took the fly very deep. By 8am, we had caught and released 4 kingfish, and the trip could already be labelled a success.                                Things went quiet after that, possibly because it was around the high tide. We explored some other bays without success. We went out towards Palm Beach and found some tailor chomping bait on the surface.                                                             Here is a photo of Barrenjoey Lighthouse.                                We then found a high bait school on the fishfinder. Looking at the top righthand display, all the red part from 10-20 ft were anchovies, with bonito, kingfish and flathead feeding on them.                                I hooked up on a kingfish which burnt my fingers with tension from the fly line. After some anxious moments, we brought this kingfish on board.                                Ken got a bonito, and then I got one. These make great sashimi!                                While all this was happening, Justin took half a dozen flathead, this being the largest one (estimated at 80cm) but was lost at the boat. It would have been released anyway.                                Overall, it was a fantastic trip and Justin an extremely knowledgable and generous guide.   Day 3 Pittwater on Our Own   Following the previous day’s lesson, we went back to the same place to do our homework. Early in the day, we came accoss bonito chasing bait on the surface, but by the time we positioned the boat, they had moved on.   A school of bonito came up not far from the boat and I gunned the boat into position, Ken struggling to stay onboard. He put the fly right in the center of the school, while it was feeding and stripped it back. Absolutely nothing happened! We chased the bonito for a while with no success and then explored other areas, also with no success.   Coming back to Church Point, we chased bonito that were coming up near a construction area, again with no success. Then, one rose in front of us, Ken cast a lure at it, and hooked up. He was on for a brief period of time and the fish came off. There were other bonito following it, and with only about a meter of line out of the rod, splashed the lure on the surface. A second bonito took the lure and he landed this fish.                                Soon after, we ran into Justin at Church Point. He had found a lot of bait and caught lots of fish and suggested we try at Salt Pan Cove. We went there and found a large school of bait between all the boats, so we anchored and fished. Soon we caught our first kingfish by ourselves on fly. Strong winds and heavy rain came in so we called it a day.                                Blisters after 2 days of fly-fishing. Ken had a bruised abdomen from fighting kingfish.                                Day 4 Sydney Harbour   On the last day, we did sightseeing. This was done by fly-fishing in Sydney Harbour for luderick (blackfish). We started by bait fishing with sea cabbage and quickly caught and released a fish. We spent the next hour fly-fishing for them with no result. Then Ken put some cabbage on his fly, and caught another one on his first drift. We then tried the fly again with no result. Finally, he put cabbage on his fly and caught a fish on the second drift. Guess we need to work on our fly pattern …                                                                                          ","categories": ["fishing"],

Unfortunately it was a bit too long and wide for our hall. After making a large number of proposed cut lines, P and I were in agreement!                                Which line was it?                                Thought a long time about the style of legs to use. Decided on a trestle table, and it was P’s idea to use the part cut away from the back of the table as the stretcher. Making the legs, these are a prototype using radiata pine. I am planning to use fancier timber after verifying the proportions (but know there’s a chance I’ll never get round to it).                                Checking table size in the hall. Stretcher not in place yet.                                Dry fit.                                Taping up table top so when I fill voids from the other size with epoxy, it does not leak through.                                Gluing up table legs and filling holes with epoxy. The epoxy used was West Systems with 206 slow hardener and ebony black aniline dye from Lee Valley. The photo shows the underside of the board which had the most voids.                                Flattening underside of table top. Also bevelled the edges a little.                                There are a lot of choices for finishing (including boiled linseed oil, tung oil, polyurethane varnish, blends such as Danish oil and epoxy). Since I didn’t want one that would make the wood look yellow and it didn’t need to be particularly durable, decided on polyurethane. Struggled with whether to use water-based polyurethane varnish or oil-based but ended up choosing the latter. This was mainly because it is hard to get a good finish with water-based unless you spray. Anyway, I’m happy with the choice, it really brought up the contrast in the wood (photo shows underside again).

I finally tracked the problem to my Macbook which is introducing noise to the radio (could be the USB to USB-C adapter) and WSPR-X also crashes a lot during transmission. After switching to an antique Dell Latitude D520 from 2006, my signal on 40m (7.038600 MHz) is being received.     Here is the database output from wsprnet.org, of unique spots sorted by distance owith transmit power from 5-100 W. I was able to hit the US, Canada, Japan, Western Australia, etc with 100 W.

I did this under a Windows 7 VirtualBox virtual machine since I thought all I needed was the Icom cloning software which is only available under Windows. Here is a list of steps:           Purchase (or make) an Icom OPC-478UC programming cable. These are about US$60 but I purchased a clone from ebay (https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/3-5mm-USB-Programming-Cable-OPC-478U-ICOM-IC-F11-IC-F11S-IC-2200H-IC-2720H-Q2Q0-/252991340381) for $5 Australian.            The cable needs to be plugged into the right hand female port of the radio (looking from the back). It showed up as a Prolific Technology USB Serial Controller [0300] under VirtualBox so I installed the Windows 7 driver here  http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?p_id=225&amp;pcid=41  after which Windows created a com port (com3).            Install the Icom cloning software https://www.icom.co.jp/world/support/download/firm/IC-2730A_E/1_00/. I thought I would be able to cut and paste the repeater list into this application but I couldn’t figure out how to do that …            Install the Chirp software from https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home            Obtain the WIA Australian repeater directory from http://www.wia.org.au/members/repeaters/data/ (the “Example VBScript, Sorted Directory csv and CHIRP csv files and other csv formats” file) and unzip.            In Chirp, (a) download the radio data using the Radio -&gt; Download from radio menu (b) File -&gt; Import the appropriate csv file from the chirp directory from (4). I used NSW\\chirp_Sydney.csv (c) It then gives you the option to select the repeaters you wish to import, I just clicked OK. (d) Radio -&gt; Upload (e) Switch radio off and on again            I then cloned the radio using the Icom cloning software from (2) so I have an Icom icf file of my configuration.

        "title": "Fishing Utah 2018",
        "excerpt":"Prior to the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference in Salt Lake City, went on an awesome fly-fishing trip, hosted by Brent in Provo, Utah. My previous trip was in 2008 (http://phwl.org/fishing-renovating-and-ballroom-dancing-in-utah-2008/).                                  Here we are in the high country, with myself on the left, Brent in the middle and Ken on the right.                                Day 1   Arrived in Los Angeles at 6am on the 12/6/2018. Ken had the rental car ready by the time I reached Salt Lake City at 11:20am. By 4:30pm, we were on the water.                                As the sun started falling, Ken was into fish, having caught them on a fly called a “Chubby Chernobyl”, which is a stonefly imitation.                                The result was zero fish and a terrible fishing day. I hooked the trees behind, grass in front and nearly fell into the river with alarming frequency. Guess it was jet-lag. Anyway, I don’t like to peak too early on a fishing trip…   Day 2   Fished the Provo River which was very high, so high that even Brent nearly floated away while wading. He played a very large fish for a while but it broke his line.                                                             A swarm of butterflies.                                Don’t know why these sheep were herded down the cliff.                                We went to Sportman’s Warehouse to buy some flies for the afternoon.                                                             Since we did so well the previous afternoon, fished the same river. This was my first brown trout of the trip.                                Went to Walmart to buy supplies for the next day as we were going to a town called “Paradise”.                                We also had to fill up for petrol and was genuinely shocked by the 100 oz (3 litre) cups. If you were to fill it with Coca Cola, it would contain about 0.3 kg of sugar and 1200 calories. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends about 38g per day.                                Stayed in a cabin at Sportsman’s Paradise.                                The next morning we were met by our guide Dan who had a degree in fishing. Dan was impressed with our gear and stories of success the previous days and we were worried we might have oversold our abilities. We told him not to judge until he saw us actually fly-fish. He then asked if we were into catching large fish on dry fly. What that a rhetorical question?   The Chair Pond which was a shallow pool with lots of clearly visible large trout, which as promised proved frustratingly difficult to catch. We beat the water to a froth for about half an hour, putting down most of the rising fish until Brent hooked the first.                                It was a beautiful, obese rainbow trout.                                Soon after, I figured out what to do: look for a cruising fish and lead them with a tiny ant pattern which was about 3mm long. I hooked one which immediately launched itself in my direction, creating slack line and throwing the hook. About 5 minutes later, using the same strategy, I managed to fool this nice rainbow.                                We then fished along a canal where there were plenty of fish. Here is Brent netting one for Ken.                                                             Dan’s fancy rod holder setup made from Harbour Freight magnets and sticky tape.                                Then we visited the “Hatchery”, there is no way anybody can fail to catch a fish here, and it was a complete turkey shoot!                                Sportsman’s Paradise reminded me of the following quote from John Milton in Paradise Lost:   “The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven..”   Day 3   Went up into the high country, about 10,000 feet (3000 m) above sea level. Stopped at a local supermarket for food and was impressed they had fishing, camping and ammo departments.                                                             Here we are at the carpark, about to start our hike.                                                             The walk was difficult as the air was quite thin due to altitude. We huffed our way up to the high lakes. The scenery was spectacular.                                                                                          It wasn’t looking good initially, with very few fish being seen. In fly-fishing, there are sometimes moments of perfection. We saw a fish rise and I cast a Royal Wulff to it. The fish was completely fooled by the fly (actually mountain fish are quite dumb as not many people fish for them), and I was rewarded by my first brook trout. These don’t grow as large as rainbow trout and brown trout, and this one is quite a good specimen. Note the spots are a different colour to browns and rainbows, and the bottom fins are red.                                                             We then fished an even high altitude lake. Up there the ice was still melting.                                                                                          We did very well on the last lake, catching lots of brook trout but none of them very large.                                Day 4   Fished a different river which was very clear and lots of fish. Fishing was not great as they were very spooky, as dozens of anglers had fished through before we got there. After about an hour, I did get a fish to take a nymph (underneath power lines which I am certain attract fish) but didn’t hook up.                                I did learn a new word though: “s’more” (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%27more).                                That evening we took our hosts to Texas Steakhouse in Brent’s car.                                I like that place, while waiting they have complimentary peanuts and you can throw the shells on the floor.                                    Day 5   Got up early and fished the river of Day 1 again.                                Nice brown trout.                                We did really well and caught lots of fish. We were congratulating ourselves that we had peaked at the right time on the last day but were sorry Brent wasn’t there. We fished the bridge next to the carpark and raised another couple of fish each and then Ken took a pretty good brown.   We then went to a new place next to a bridge. On my first cast a huge fish poked its head out of the water to inspect my fly but didn’t take it. It was so big it left me shaking. I then caught a few fish out of that pool and went to the next.   My first cast into the next pool had me connected to a large fish. It swam upstream but I managed to keep it from getting too far away. It then charged downstream and I had to apply a lot of force to keep it in sight. After quite a struggle I got my best fish of the trip to shore. I had already taken my camera out but while trying to set up the shot, it shook its head, broke the line and disappeared.   Went to find Ken (Brent didn’t join us as it was Father’s Day). He was in the process of landing this large rainbow trout and he had similar success. What a wonderful end to a fantastic trip!                                ","categories": ["fishing"],

About 14 hours later (Hong Kong - Shenzhen - Guangzhou - Chengdu) we arrived in Chengdu. Glad we took the fast train.                               This is a photo of Chengdu from our hotel above the train station.                               We then moved to a hotel downtown and had Sichuan food.

Here is a Red Panda.                               We were there the entire morning and this was the only photo I made of an animate panda.     A highlight was the Jinsha archaeological site which was only discovered in 2001 (accidentally when they were digging the foundations to build units). There, they found remains of the Shu Kingdom (1200-600 BC).   They chose to leave the site as it was found.                                                             There is also a museum where the stone, ivory, jade, bronze and gold artefacts were displayed.                               Shang Dynasty chariot.                               Probably the most well known exhibit, the Golden Mask.                               One thing that I like very much about Sichuan is that they still have a tea culture. This has vanished from places like Beijing and Shanghai. We had tea in this beautiful tea shop near the Jiasha site.                               We then took the train back to Hong Kong for the PAPAA workshop.                                The workshop was hosted by Prof Hayden So at HKU and we all thank him for a wonderful event with superb food.                                                                                                                                                                                One of the afternoons, I went to Shenzhen to visit CTaccel.                               I often get asked which camera I use. For this post, it was a mix of iPhone, Xiaomi 6 pro phone, Canon Ixus S120 and Olympus E-PM2. It is usually a matter of convenience as I often find it hard to tell which photo was taken with what.

        "title": "International Lighthouse and Lightship Weekend 2018",
        "excerpt":"                             The Manly Warringah Radio Society (VK2MB) has participated in the International Lighthouse and Lightship Weekend (https://illw.net/) since 2003. This year we hosted our friends Lindsay VK2AMV, Dave VK2JDS and Garry VK2FGAZ from the Amateur Radio Central West Group. As in previous years, we activated the historic Barrenjoey Lighthouse, 30 km north of Sydney (lighthouse code AU0046 https://illw.net/index.php/entrants-list-2018). We met in the beach carpark at 8:30 Saturday morning to distribute the gear for the trek up to the magnificent sandstone lighthouse and lighthouse keepers cottages. Also, as in previous years, it was extremely blustery from Saturday afternoon onwards and the 50 km/h winds were “strong enough to blow a dog off its chain” (as Dave was fond of telling our HF contacts).   The location has beautiful views at night.                                                             This is the same view (looking south) as the subsequent photo the next morning at sunrise.                                The antenna used was an Off-Center Fed Dipole (OCFD) in an inverted V arrangement. The SWR with the OCFD oriented about N-W (long leg) to S-E (short leg) and the feed-point on the north-side of the lighthouse balustrade, the SWR was about 1.6 at 3.6MHz, but was 1.5 or less (1.3 minimum) on 40m to 15m.                                Operations were from the comfort of the Caretaker’s Cottage using the VK2MB callsign. We used an Icom IC7300 for our HF contacts and a Yaesu FT-7900 for 2m operation. Contacts were logged using the VKCL contest logging software (http://www.mnds.com.au/vkcl/). Here is a photo of Dave operating and Garry logging.                                Five diehards operated from dusk.                                All the way through the night.                                To the morning.                                As usual there crowds of visitors walking up the hill to admire the lighthouse and surrounding view, literally from sunrise to after sunset on both days. On the Sunday the National Park volunteers were providing guided tours of the historic lighthouse, but unfortunately by midday they were forced to cancel their tours due to the high winds at the top of the lighthouse. By early afternoon, we too decided to pack our gear up and reluctantly leave this magnificent location for another year.   All up we operated voice on 80m (the lowest frequency supported by our antenna), 40m, 20m and 2m. Over the weekend the HF band conditions were quite favourable, apart from 80m QRN due to lightning storms out in the Tasman sea on Saturday night.   In total over the weekend we achieved 103 contacts. Although the ILLW is not a contest per se, we endeavoured to work each station only once (as opposed to once per band or once per time limit etc) to keep the number of contacts down (ie making the logging easier, etc).   There were a total of 54 lighthouses around Australia were registered to participate of which we worked 26 Australian light houses - a great percentage worked! We also worked three NZ lighthouses, and a sprinkling of DX contacts “just for fun” eg Noumea, Tokyo and Russia.   This year we maintained our long standing tradition and also once again worked the unofficial/fun Todd River lighthouse in Alice Springs(!) that make an effort to participate every year. Horst (VK2HL) happened to be in Alice Springs on holidays at that time and sent us this photo of their operations (below). We later worked Horst from the caravan park.                                On the Saturday and Sunday various members of the Society trekked up the hill to pay us a day visit and also to act as pack horses to carry up/down all the various items of hardware and provisions that we needed to support our operations. Thanks goes to them for their efforts. As an aside we did observe that VK2GHB (by some unknown means) had persuaded a random tourist to carry up his pack for him! He must be management material!   The Manly Warringah Radio Society members that attended/operated included:   Tim VK2BT Philip VK2APL Mike VK2UCT and XYL Di Geoff VK2TGO Bob VK2RL Roger VK2GHB Richard VK2NRA Nick VK2FS and Zara Mal VK2TMF Sean VK2THT   Amateur Radio Central West Group participants were: Lindsay VK2AMV Dave VK2JDS Garry VK2FGAZ   Our other amateur friends that visited us at Barrenjoey were: Dave VK2BDA Matt VK2BAI   All in all another great experience for us all! Beautiful location, great weather (no rain!), fantastic company, oh and some amatuer radio thrown in! What could be better than that??   Here is the final log.

        "excerpt":"Q&amp;A session with Nobel laureates Joachim Frank (Columbia) and Dan Shechtman (Technion, Israel), moderated by Julie Carney.   Professor Shechtman won the 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of quasicrystals. Professor Frank’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 2017 for developing cryo-electron microscopy for the high-resolution structure determination of biomolecules in solution                                  Prof Dan Shechtman           Did you worry when people (such as Linus Pauling) said your work was wrong? I am my own hardest critic of my own work so I verify my work over and over to ensure it is correct.            How do you find what to research? What you should pursue comes by chance, learn lots of things, find something you are interested in and become an expert.            Did Nobel Prize change your life? Nobel Prize is a license to do whatever you want and you have to choose what you want to do.            _How are things changing for the younger generation for the worse and better? _As technology develops we need people that are experts in different things e.g. nobody can make a cellphone by themselves. In the past you could only become an entrepreneur if your father owned a factory, now everybody has the opportunity.       Prof Joachim Frank           Is it harder for researchers now than before? Compared to 30 years ago researchers now have tools such as the internet for communications which allow scientific collaborations that were not feasible in the past.            How are things changing for the younger generation for the worse and better? Social media has created a dystopic environment. People need to look at their phones every 2 minutes and have serious attention deficit. Awareness has dramatically improved about world events, transcending the idea of nation states.            _Advice to a scientist embarking on their career. _If you have an idea that you have checked and believe in, don’t let someone discourage you.

It was forecast to be 13-31 Celcius, 10 degrees above the average and the first warm day of spring. Wind was to pick up to 30 km/h in the afternoon.                                  We had a bit of a late start (despite my getting up at 5:30am) and started pumping saltwater yabbies for bait at 7:45am.                                But by 8am we were off fishing.                                It was a good day with our first fish being caught before we finished making coffee. About 20 minutes later, caught a nice sized flathead followed by another bream on the same draft. Within a couple of hours we had a nice bag of bream and flathead.

        "title": "FPT18 Workshop on Embedded Machine Learning",
        "excerpt":"Embedded Machine Learning: Technology and Opportunities   International Conference on Field Programmable Technology Naha, Okinawa http://www.fpt18.sakura.ne.jp/workshop.html December 14, 2018 (afternoon)   Organisers: David Boland and Philip Leong, The University of Sydney   This workshop will provide a forum to discuss technical challenges and product opportunities for applying deep learning within embedded systems that take advantage of the energy and latency benefits offered by field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In particular, the following questions will be addressed:           Is current academic research addressing the needs of industry? What are the new research problems important to them?            What are the new markets and applications created by FPGA-based machine learning?            Will FPGAs be able to capture a significant marketshare, or will hardware-accelerated machine learning be consolidated such that application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are the preferred solution?         The format is a 2-hour panel session with guests representing industry and academia. Each speaker will be given 10-15 minutes to briefly state their positions regarding the above questions. We will then open the floor to questions from the audience, which we expect to lead to engaging discussions.   We hope that by attending this workshop you will learn about new embedded applications that could benefit from the use of FPGA accelerated machine learning, as well as the technical challenges that need to be addressed in order to make this a reality. Furthermore, by gathering likeminded individuals, this workshop provides an opportunity to develop collaborations with panellists or other attendees.

This comprehensive list of CD player mechanisms at http://www.dutchaudioclassics.nl/philips_cdm_cd_mechanism_list/ (local copy) showed I needed a Philips CDM12.1 mechanism. This was easy to find on ebay as a “VAM1201 VAM1202 CDM12.1 CDM12.2 laser transport mechanism for Philips NEW”. Total cost with free shipping from Hong Kong was $13.   I also found this detailed guide to replacing the laser mechanism https://www.hifigear.co.uk/blog/marantz-cd63se-laser-transport-mechanism-replacement/ and the Marantz-CD-67-SE-Service-Manual (which wasn’t that helpful for this particular repair).

        "title": "Grass Valley Fly-Fishing 2019",
        "excerpt":"The FPGA Fly-Fishing Symposium 2019 (FFF’19) was a post-FPGA Conference workshop, attended by Guy, Ken and I.                                I am not the superstitious type but we received many encouraging signs in Monterey.                                                             We had planned to fish with a guide the first day of the trip and then do our own thing on the second. The Yuba River Skwala hatch relied on the weather and the bugs to cooperate. Ken had tied 800 flies for this trip. Here is one of his four boxes.                                Of course the weather didn’t cooperate. The day before the trip, apocalyptic rains were being forecast, with our fishing spot being at the center of the circle. The guide said it could be as bad as 2017, which strangely enough was the previous time we planned to fish the Yuba. As it turned out, they had 6 inches of rain, 7ft of snow in the mountains, roads were flooded and schools closed.      So the night before, we were scrambling to find a fly-fishing option. This turned out to be fishing in the lake for spotted bass in Bullards Bar Reservoir, the place from which the world record at 11 pounds 4 ounces was caught. Before this trip we’d never even heard of spotted bass.   We stayed at the Gold Miner’s Inn, which I mistakenly booked through getaroom.com for $100 more than on the hotel’s website. Arrived there at 9:30pm after a 6 hour drive from the conference venue in Monterey.   The next day got up at 5:30am to go fishing with Chuck Ragan.                                There is a fine line between fishing and standing in the rain looking like an idiot. We were hoping it would be the latter but here is video of us doing the former.            Chuck was really cool, laid back and even more enthusiastic than ourselves. He kept saying he was pleased to find people willing to go out in the pouring rain. Bullard’s Bar was completely empty, no cars in the carpark and we didn’t see any other people the entire day.                                                                                          We were using #7 weight rods with floating lines. Due to miscommunication, I brought my #5 and #9 and left my #7 in San Jose. We fished weighted bait imitation wet flies about 12 ft under a small float.                                Here is a nice slow motion video that Chuck took of Ken casting.            It wasn’t long before we were into fish.                                                                                                Things were going well, even the rain stopped for a bit and then Guy pulled out a banana (actually he had two). As everybody knows, such a stunt is completely unacceptable and we were preparing to be immediately beset with misfortune (see https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/banana-ban/). If it were my boat, Guy would have been walking the plank.                                As mentioned earlier, I’m not superstitious and would even allow Banana Boat sunscreen on my boat (what a stupid brand name, I use Cancer Council). However, real bananas were just asking for swift retribution. Chuck, Ken and I were already planning how to swim to shore when the boat sank. Fortunately, our luck continued (even though I swear it started raining again at that point).                                                                We ended up with about 2 dozen fish (all released). As Chuck predicted, the discolored, rising water and outflow from the creeks made for a brilliant day of fishing.                                We didn’t have a plan for the next day and it was either going to the shopping mall or booking another guide as the rivers were still unfishable and a boat was needed. Chuck was not available but he fixed us up to fish Lake Oroville with Hogan Brown.                                                                                          Ken caught the first fish which was a nice fat spotted bass.                                We caught a few more and they larger than the ones at Bullards.                                                                                                                       Ken took the largest fish of the trip.                                                             We had another great day, catching about half a dozen fish. Hogan had a very colorful personality and was a great guide. He is also an American History school teacher (but schools were closed due to the floods), published author, and co-founder of Cast Hope, a nonprofit organization that takes young people on free, guided fly fishing trips.                                The FFF is one of my annual highlights and we lament that though we have known each other for about 15 years, it is only since 2015 that we’ve been fishing together. Thanks to Ken, Guy, Chuck and Hogan for another memorable trip.   ","categories": ["fishing"],

        "title": "Mako on Fly - San Diego 2019",
        "excerpt":"The mako shark is one of the fastest and most ferocious fish in the sea. They can swim up to 69 km/h (42 mph) and jump 6m (20 feet) in the air. There two species, the shortfin (Isurus oxyrinchus) and the longfin (_Isurus paucus), _the shortfin being more common. San Diego is the best place to fish for them, and so following the FCCM Conference, Ken and I went to fly-fish for them.                                                             We booked one of the pioneers of mako fly fishing, Conway Bowman. He is famous, even has his own TV show. We met at Dana Landing and went a few miles offshore.                                The tides were perfect with the high at 8:30am and the low at 2:30pm. There was a slight swell, cold, windy and it looked like it was going to rain. At the fishing spot, we were greeted by a school of porpoises. That was a good sign as the sharks often follow them around.            After setting up the burley (chum), we got our gear in order and made a few practise casts.                                Size #14 rod and reel with floating fly-line. Not sure what size hook, might have been a 6/0.                                No problem seeing this fly, I think it is a bird imitation.                                                             Then we sat around for 7 hours …   Right on the low tide, a mako appeared. Conway teased it in and Ken had it take the fly twice with the fish coming towards the boat but didn’t hook up. This was the third attempt.                                                                                          This time Ken was able to set the hook while it was moving away from the boat.                                                             and it was on …                                                             Here is a video.            Ken did a good job getting the fish to the boat.                                                             Conway expertly unhooked and released the fish, estimated at about 25 lbs.                                                                      About an hour later, a school of mackerel came by and for about 20 minutes, we caught a fish every cast. They were driving the bait to the surface and the birds were also having a feast.                                We were hoping for a large fish (or a few more), but gave it our best shot. May is the start of the season with June/July being the most productive months. The best chance of big fish is in August and Conway fishes off Long Beach for them at that time. He catches them up to 300 lb, with larger ones being unstoppable and involves chasing the fish full speed with the boat. We were fortunately to catch one under difficult conditions. It was a great experience and we look forward to returning.   ","categories": ["fishing"],

        "title": "Ten Lessons I wish I had been Taught - Gian-Carlo Rota",
        "excerpt":"Interesting talk by the late MIT mathematician and philosopher   https://www.ams.org/notices/199701/comm-rota.pdf     Ten Lessons I wish I had been Taught   Gian-Carlo Rota   MIT, April 20 , 1996 on the occasion of the Rotafest   Allow me to begin by allaying one of your worries. I will not spend the next half hour thanking you for participating in this conference, or for your taking time away from work to travel to Cambridge.   And to allay another of your probable worries, let me add that you are not about to be subjected to a recollection of past events similar to the ones I’ve been publishing for some years, with a straight face and an occasional embellishment of reality.   Having discarded these two choices for this talk, I was left without a title. Luckily I remembered an MIT colloquium that took place in the late fifties; it was one of the first I attended at MIT. The speaker was Eugenio Calabi. Sitting in the front row of the audience were Norbert Wiener, asleep as usual until the time came to applaud, and Dirk Struik who had been one of Calabi’s teachers when Calabi was an undergraduate at MIT in the forties. The subject of the lecture was beyond my competence. After the first five minutes I was completely lost. At the end of the lecture, an arcane dialogue took place between the speaker and some members of the audience, Ambrose and Singer if I remember correctly. There followed a period of tense silence. Professor Struik broke the ice. He raised his hand and said:“Give us something to take home!” Calabi obliged, and in the next five minutes he explained in beautiful simple terms the gist of his lecture. Everybody filed out with a feeling of satisfaction.   Dirk Struik was right: a speaker should try to give his audience something they can take home. But what? I have been collecting some random bits of advice that I keep repeating to myself, do’s and don’ts of which I have been and will always be guilty. Some of you have been exposed to one or more of these tidbits. Collecting these items and presenting them in one speech may be one of the less obnoxious among options of equal presumptuousness. The advice we give others is the advice that we ourselves need. Since it is too late for me to learn these lessons, I will discharge my unfulfilled duty by dishing them out to you. They will be stated in order of increasing controversiality.   _ _1 Lecturing   The following four requirements of a good lecture do not seem to be altogether obvious, judging from the mathematics lectures I have been listening to for the past forty-six years.   a. Every lecture should make only one main point The German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel wrote that any philosopher who uses the word “and” too often cannot be a good philosopher. I think he was right, at least insofar as lecturing goes. Every lecture should state one main point and repeat it over and over, like a theme with variations. An audience is like a herd of cows, moving slowly in the direction they are being driven towards. If we make one point, we have a good chance that the audience will take the right direction; if we make several points, then the cows will scatter all over the field. The audience will lose interest and everyone will go back to the thoughts they interrupted in order to come to our lecture.   b. Never run overtime Running overtime is the one unforgivable error a lecturer can make. After fifty minutes (one microcentury as von Neumann used to say) everybody’s attention will turn elsewhere even if we are trying to prove the Riemann hypothesis. One minute overtime can destroy the best of lectures.   c. Relate to your audience As you enter the lecture hall, try to spot someone in the audience with whose work you have some familiarity. Quickly rearrange your presentation so as to manage to mention some of that person’s work. In this way, you will guarantee that at least one person will follow with rapt attention, and you will make a friend to boot.   Everyone in the audience has come to listen to your lecture with the secret hope of hearing their work mentioned.   d. Give them something to take home It is not easy to follow Professor Struik’s advice. It is easier to state what features of a lecture the audience will always remember, and the answer is not pretty. I often meet, in airports, in the street and occasionally in embarrassing situations, MIT alumni who have taken one or more courses from me. Most of the time they admit that they have forgotten the subject of the course, and all the mathematics I thought I had taught them. However, they will gladly recall some joke, some anecdote, some quirk, some side remark, or some mistake I made.   _ _2 Blackboard Technique   Two points.   a. Make sure the blackboard is spotless It is particularly important to erase those distracting whirls that are left when we run the eraser over the blackboard in a non uniform fashion.   By starting with a spotless blackboard, you will subtly convey the impression that the lecture they are about to hear is equally spotless.   b. Start writing on the top left hand corner What we write on the blackboard should correspond to what we want an attentive listener to take down in his notebook. It is preferable to write slowly and in a large handwriting, with no abbreviations. Those members of the audience who are taking notes are doing us a favor, and it is up to us to help them with their copying. When slides are used instead of the blackboard, the speaker should spend some time explaining each slide, preferably by adding sentences that are inessential, repetitive or superfluous, so as to allow any member of the audience time to copy our slide. We all fall prey to the illusion that a listener will find the time to read the copy of the slides we hand them after the lecture. This is wishful thinking.   3 Publish the same result several times   After getting my degree, I worked for a few years in functional analysis. I bought a copy of Frederick Riesz’ Collected Papers as soon as the big thick heavy oversize volume was published. However, as I began to leaf through, I could not help but notice that the pages were extra thick, almost like cardboard. Strangely, each of Riesz’ publications had been reset in exceptionally large type. I was fond of Riesz’ papers, which were invariably beautifully written and gave the reader a feeling of definitiveness.   As I looked through his Collected Papers however, another picture emerged. The editors had gone out of their way to publish every little scrap Riesz had ever published. It was clear that Riesz’ publications were few. What is more surprising is that the papers had been published several times. Riesz would publish the first rough version of an idea in some obscure Hungarian journal. A few years later, he would send a series of notes to the French Academy’s Comptes Rendus in which the same material was further elaborated. A few more years would pass, and he would publish the definitive paper, either in French or in English. Adam Koranyi, who took courses with Frederick Riesz, told me that Riesz would lecture on the same subject year after year, while meditating on the definitive version to be written. No wonder the final version was perfect.   Riesz’ example is worth following. The mathematical community is split into small groups, each one with its own customs, notation and terminology. It may soon be indispensable to present the same result in several versions, each one accessible to a specific group; the price one might have to pay otherwise is to have our work rediscovered by someone who uses a different language and notation, and who will rightly claim it as his own.   4 You are more likely to be remembered by your expository work   Let us look at two examples, beginning with Hilbert. When we think of Hilbert, we think of a few of his great theorems, like his basis theorem. But Hilbert’s name is more often remembered for his work in number theory, his Zahlbericht, his book Foundations of Geometry and for his text on integral equations. The term “Hilbertspace” was introduced by Stone and von Neumann in recognition of Hilbert’s textbook on integral equations, in which the word “spectrum” was first defined at least twenty years before the discovery of quantum mechanics. Hilbert’s textbook on integral equations is in large part expository, leaning on the work of Hellinger and several other mathematicians whose names are now forgotten.   Similarly, Hilbert’s Foundations of Geometry, the book that made Hilbert’s name a household word among mathematicians, contains little original work, and reaps the harvest of the work of several geometers, such as Kohn, Schur (not the Schur you have heard of), Wiener (another Wiener), Pasch, Pieri and several other Italians.   Again, Hilbert’s Zahlbericht, a fundamental contribution that revolutionized the field of number theory, was originally a survey that Hilbert was commissioned to write for publication in the Bulletin ofthe German Mathematical Society.   William Feller is another example. Feller is remembered as the author of the most successful treatise on probability ever written. Few probabilists of our day are able to cite more than a couple of Feller’s research papers; most mathematicians are not even aware that Feller had a previous life in convex geometry.   Allow me to digress with a personal reminiscence. I sometimes publish in a branch of philosophy called phenomenology. After publishing my first paper in this subject, I felt deeply hurt when, at a meeting of the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy, I was rudely told in no uncertain terms that everything I wrote in my paper was well known. This scenario occurred more than once, and I was eventually forced to reconsider my publishing standards in phenomenology.   It so happens that the fundamental treatises of phenomenology are written in thick, heavy philosophical German. Tradition demands that no examples ever be given of what one is talking about. One day I decided, not without serious misgivings, to publish a paper that was essentially an updating of some paragraphs from a book by Edmund Husserl, with a few examples added. While I was waiting for the worst at the next meeting of the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy, a prominent phenomenologist rushed towards me with a smile on his face. He was full of praise for my paper, and he strongly encouraged me to further develop the novel and original ideas presented in it.   5 Every mathematician has only a few tricks   A long time ago an older and well known number theorist made some disparaging remarks about Paul Erdos’ work. You admire contributions to mathematics as much as I do, and I felt annoyed when the older mathematician flatly and definitively stated that all of Erdos’ work could be reduced to a few tricks which Erdos repeatedly relied on in his proofs. What the number theorist did not realize is that other mathematicians, even the very best, also rely on a few tricks which they use over and over. Take Hilbert. The second volume of Hilbert’s collected papers contains Hilbert’s papers in invariant theory. I have made a point of reading some of these papers with care. It is sad to note that some of Hilbert’s beautiful results have been completely forgotten. But on reading the proofs of Hilbert’s striking and deep theorems in invariant theory, it was surprising to verify that Hilbert’s proofs relied on the same few tricks. Even Hilbert had only a few tricks!   6 Do not worry about your mistakes   Once more let me begin with Hilbert. When the Germans were planning to publish Hilbert’s collected papers and to present him with a set on the occasion of one of his later birthdays, they realized that they could not publish the papers in their original versions because they were full of errors, some of them quite serious. Thereupon they hired a young unemployed mathematician, Olga Taussky-Todd, to go over Hilbert’s papers and correct all mistakes. Olga labored for three years; it turned out that all mistake scould be corrected without any major changes in the statement of the theorems. There was one exception, a paper Hilbert wrote in his old age, which could not be fixed; it was a purported proof of the continuum hypothesis, you will find it in a volume of the Mathematische Annalen of the early thirties. At last, on Hilbert’s birthday, a freshly printed set of Hilbert’s collected papers was presented to the Geheimrat. Hilbert leafed through them carefully and did not notice anything.   Now let us shift to the other end of the spectrum, and allow me to relate another personal anecdote. In the summer of 1979, while attending a philosophy meeting in Pittsburgh, I was struck with a case of detached retinas. Thanks to Joni’s prompt intervention, I managed to be operated on in the nick of time and my eyesight was saved.   On the morning after the operation, while I was lying on a hospital bed with my eyes bandaged, Joni dropped in to visit. Since I was to remain in that Pittsburgh hospital for at least a week, we decided to write a paper. Joni fished a manuscript out of my suitcase, and I mentioned to her that the text had a few mistakes which she could help me fix.   There followed twenty minutes of silence while she went through the draft. “Why, it is all wrong!” she finally remarked in her youthful voice. She was right. Every statement in the manuscript had something wrong. Nevertheless, after laboring for a while, she managed to correct every mistake, and the paper was eventually published.   There are two kinds of mistakes. There are fatal mistakes that destroy a theory; but there are also contingent ones, which are useful in testing the stability of a theory.   7 Use the Feynman method   Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say: “How did he do it? He must be a genius!”   8 Give lavish acknowledgments   I have always felt miffed after reading a paper in which I felt I was not being given proper credit, and it is safe to conjecture that the same happens to everyone else. One day, I tried an experiment. After writing a rather long paper, I began to draft a thorough bibliography. On the spur of the moment, I decided to cite a few papers which had nothing whatsoever to do with the content of my paper, to see what might happen.   Somewhat to my surprise, I received letters from two of the authors whose papers I believed were irrelevant to my article. Both letters were written in an emotionally charged tone. Each of the authors warmly congratulated me for being the first to acknowledge their contribution to the field.   9 Write informative introductions   Nowadays, reading a mathematics paper from top to bottom is a rare event. If we wish our paper to be read, we had better provide our prospective readers with strong motivation to do so. A lengthy introduction, summarizing the history of the subject, giving everybody his due, and perhaps enticingly outlining the content of the paper in a discursive manner, will go some of the way towards getting us a couple of readers.   As the editor of the journal Advances in Mathematics, I have often sent submitted papers back to the authors with the recommendation that they lengthen their introduction. On occasion I received by return mail a message from the author, stating that the same paper had been previously rejected by Annals of Mathematics because the introduction was already too long.   10 Be prepared for old age   My late friend Stan Ulam used to remark that his life was sharply divided into two halves. In the first half, he was always the youngest person in the group; in the second half, he was always the oldest. There was no transitional period.   I now realize how right he was. The etiquette of old age does not seem to have been written up, and we have to learn it the hard way. It depends on a basic realization, which takes time to adjust to. You must realize that, after reaching a certain age, you are no longer viewed as a person. You become an institution, and you are treated the way institutions are treated. You are expected to behave like a piece of period furniture, an architectural landmark, or an incunabulum.   It matters little whether you keep publishing or not. If your papers are no good, they will say, “What did you expect? He is a fixture!” and if an occasional paper of yours is found to be interesting, they will say, “What did you expect? He has been working at this all his life!” The only sensible response is to enjoy playing your newly-found role as an institution.   ","categories": ["academia"],

I will be switching them over at some point and moved the old domain to a spare http://uxa.apl.mybluehost.me/.   Most programmers use github which offers Github Pages for website hosting. The advantages over Wordpress plus hosting are:     It is free.   Websites can be edited with a normal text editor.   It is hosted by Github so version control etc is integrated.   A local copy is available so scripts to automate updating the website etc are simple and changes can be made while offline.   It is easy to make backups.   Latex rendering is easy.   Markdown makes code blocks easier.   I managed to move phwl.org to Github under MacOS using the steps below.   Install Jekyll     Install ruby, rbenv, bundler and jekyll (I used homebrew) https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/   Install minimal-mistakes-jekyll theme     Jekyll is not compatible with the stupid Dropbox directory name 'Dropbox\\ \\(Sydney\\ Uni\\)/', and I don’t think there is a way to change it. To get around this I put my website directory outside of Dropbox and made a symbolic link (inside Dropbox) so it would be backed up   Make a copy of https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter, edit the _config.yml   bundle bundle update      To use the local server, type bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental and browse to localhost:4000.   Convert website     Use the Wordpress exporter to export old website in xml format (tried the Jekyll converter plugin but that doesn’t work for large websites). This just gives the content, without attachments etc. Then   Use exitwp to convert Wordpress to Jekyll   Copy all the images and documents from the Wordpress site (wp-content directory) using ftp. I used FileZilla from the App store for this.   Copy the _posts directory from exitwp into the Jekyll website.   Copy wp-content files into assets/images on the Jekyll website.   To make publically available, type bundle exec jekyll build and then push the files up to Github (the repository is https://github.com/phwl/phwl.github.io)   Fix _posts and _pages     This took the most time. The main changes I needed to do was to fix the headers: remove the old link header, add a teaser image (blank one if unneeded). Then I edited the image insertion code, which involved the extensive use of Python scripts to do global replacements like   import fileinput import re  for line in fileinput.input(sys.argv[1], inplace=1, backup='.bak'):     line = re.sub(r'\\[!.*\\((.+)\\).*\\]\\(.*\\)', r'[![](\\1){: .align-center}](\\1)', line.rstrip())     print(line)      I later added links to the original image with this script.   import fileinput import re  for line in fileinput.input(inplace=1, backup='.bak'):     line = re.sub('!\\[(.*)\\]\\((.*)\\)\\{: .align-center\\}',r'[![\\1](\\2){: .align-center}](\\2)', line.rstrip())     print(line)     and then changed them yet again to use the include form    {% include figure image_path=\"/assets/images/2019/10/IMG_1268.jpg\" caption=\"Shenzhen\" %}       I also used wide pages https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/markup-text-readability-wide-page/   Customise website     Since I wanted teaser images appearing on the front page, I put a copy of https://github.com/justinrummel/jr.com-mm/blob/jr-branch/_includes/archive-single.html in _includes/archive-single.html   To use a custom domain https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site   To use single pages without sidebar https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1322#issuecomment-521386064   To change home to a grid layout I changed home.html so the loop is in a grid wrapper   &lt;div class=\"grid__wrapper\"&gt; {% for post in paginator.posts %}   {% include archive-single.html type=\"grid\" %} {% endfor %} &lt;/div&gt;      Make figures linked to the image   &lt;figure class=\"{{ include.class }}\"&gt;   &lt;a href=     {% if include.image_path contains \"://\" %}       \"{{ include.image_path }}\"     {% else %}       \"{{ include.image_path | relative_url }}\"     {% endif %}&gt;   &lt;img src=     {% if include.image_path contains \"://\" %}       \"{{ include.image_path }}\"     {% else %}       \"{{ include.image_path | relative_url }}\"     {% endif %}     alt=\"{% if include.alt %}{{ include.alt }}{% endif %}\"&gt;   {% if include.caption %}     &lt;figcaption&gt;       {{ include.caption | markdownify | remove: \"&lt;p&gt;\" | remove: \"&lt;/p&gt;\" }}     &lt;/figcaption&gt;{% endif %}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;      To enable  rendering with mathjax (if it didn’t work the LaTeX symbol would not have appeared), I created a file in _includes/latex.html with   {% if page.use_math %} &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" async   src=\"https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML\"&gt; &lt;/script&gt; {% endif %}   This is similar to the approach in https://haixing-hu.github.io/programming/2013/09/20/how-to-use-mathjax-in-jekyll-generated-github-pages/.   Google analytics  Go to https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/ -&gt; Admin and create an  account for website.

        "title": "Visit to W1QG's shack",
        "excerpt":"Chris Dick was kind enough to introduce me to his friend, Dick Benson W1QG, a retired hardware development engineer. We went to visit his very impressive shack (which was not difficult to spot from the road).                                This is a high frequency (HF) software defined radio of his own design, based on a Xilinx Spartan FPGA. For the signal processing parts, he used Matlab and System Generator tools. It is documented at http://k6jca.blogspot.com/2017/02/an-fpga-sdr-hf-transceiver-part-1.html.                                On one side he had his radio gear, together with a very substantial collection of vintage test equipment.                                                                                                                                                                                 He told me this is the best amateur receiver for its time.                               Not everyone has a Caesium frequency standard at home (in fact some countries don’t have one). Dick picked this up, not working, for $300 and repaired it (had a screw loose). I later found out the original price was $32,000 which would have been enough to buy a house at the time.                               On the other side of the workshop was his mechanical stuff,  including a Harley that he restored and lots of home made  radio controlled planes.                                                            This is an engine he made from scratch, using the mill in the photo below.                                                            Thanks for a wonderful visit Dick!

Following my lecture on a Monday, I took the late night flight to Hong Kong.  Arrived at 5am and went straight to CTAccel in Shenzhen, founded by two of my ex-students, Haile Yu and Jackson Yeung. Shenzhen is an amazing city which only started being developed in the 1980s. This is the view from CTAccel.                        Shenzhen        In the afternoon, Haile, Jackson and myself went to visit Corerain, founded by my collaborators, Prof Wayne Luk of Imperial College, Dr Xinyu Niu and ex-student Dr Kuen Hung Tsoi.   HKU and MoVertical                               The next stop was Hong Kong University (HKU) to visit A/Prof Hayden So. He had arranged an excursion with his colleagues to MoVertical (more information is available on their Facebook page), an urban farm based on stackable containers. It is a laboratory environment for testing ideas in scalable, sustainable farming and we were asked for suggestions to improve automation.   I was there to see if we can help monitor fish behaviour using machine learning.                                 Mr Arthur Lee, Founder, explaining the container system.

        "excerpt":"Publications list in Markdown  For many years I’ve been using a convoluted process to generate my  publications list from separate bibtex files for journals, conferences, books, patents, etc. I thought I could do it using pandoc, but it doesn’t appear that it parses bibtex files correctly.   After quite a lot of searching, I found pybtex  which (unlike pandoc) understands bibtex bst files and can output markdown. This plus a little bit of python allowed me to generate papers.md directly from my .bib files.   import subprocess import re import os  # different bibliography categories with their names bibs = {'journal': 'Journals',     'conference': 'Conference Papers',     'patent': 'Patents',     'book': 'Books',     'bookchap': 'Chapters in Books',     'editor': 'Edited Books',     'misc': 'Miscellaneous'}  pretex = \"\"\"\\\\documentclass{article} \\\\usepackage{natbib} \\\\usepackage{hyperref} % whatever you need here, basically a good idea is to use your real thesis header \\\\begin{document} \\\\nocite{*} \\\\bibliographystyle{unsrt} \"\"\"  # create the .tex and .md files for each category for k in bibs:     intex = pretex + '\\\\bibliography{../' + k + '}\\n\\\\end{document}\\n'     with open(k+\".tex\", \"w\") as tex_file:         print(intex, file=tex_file)     os.system(\"latex {}\".format(k))     os.system(\"bibtex {}\".format(k))     os.system(\"latex {}\".format(k))     cmd = \"pybtex --style-language python --output-backend markdown {}\".format(k)     os.system(cmd)  out = \"\"\"--- comments: false permalink: papers slug: papers title: Publications classes: wide --- \"\"\" with open(\"papers.md\", \"w\") as out_file:     print(out, file=out_file)      for k in bibs:         with open(k+\".md\", \"r\") as text_file:             text = text_file.read()             print(\"# {}\\n\".format(bibs[k]), file=out_file)             print(text, file=out_file)   Publications list in LaTeX  The next problem is to get it in .

        "title": "Hard disk replacement for a mid-2011 iMac",
        "excerpt":"Today on the operating table we have a mid-2011 iMac with a dead hard disk.                                  Hardware   Although I always liked the design, display and speakers in an iMac, it runs hot and noisy, and is a pain to repair.  So when this mid-2011 iMac crossed my path, I wasn’t sure whether it would be worth fixing, particularly since Apple longer provides operating system updates.  However, I had an old 2TB Seagate Barracuda disk and it would be a shame to throw it away.   iFixit has a set of instructions for replacing the hard drive ( https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iMac+Intel+27-Inch+EMC+2429+Hard+Drive+Replacement/7555), but I think the sequence below is simplier.   The non-obvious step is opening the case. It is held in with magnets and you need a glass lifter remove the front glass assembly. Mine was from Harbour Freight https://www.harborfreight.com/dual-cup-suction-lifter-46134.html. Try not to touch the internal glass surfaces as you’ll have to clean  them afterwards!                                There are 4 screws down each vertical edge of the display assembly (8 in total). Remove those with tweezers and a T10 Torx driver. The display assembly fits tightly in the case. I used a right angle pick to get under the assembly and first lift up the top left hand side, and then the top right hand side.                                Next remove the connector for the shortest cable so you can tilt the display.                                Prop open the macbook.                                Remove the the two  T20 screws that secure the hard disk assembly to the iMac and remove the connectors.                                Hard disk assembly can come out now.                                Replace the drive and put everything back together.  After I did this, of course the display didn’t work. Had to unassemble the machine again and play around with the display connector.   Operating System  Next you need to download the High Sierra image (the latest version of MacOS that supports this machine) https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT208969 and create a bootable USB. Then boot from the USB and install to the hard disk.                                Following that, there is an issue of fan control. It’s an easy fix if you  are prepared to get the cable https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/DIDIMACHDD12/. My solution was to use this https://www.crystalidea.com/macs-fan-control.

Bunnings lent me a handsaw to cut down the 3.6~m lengths  so it would fit in the car.                                Box went together quickly.
