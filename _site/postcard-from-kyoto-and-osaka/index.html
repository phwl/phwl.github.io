<p>Following the <a href="http://www.icfpt.org">International Conference on Field Programmable Technology</a> we spent some time in Kyoto and Osaka.</p>

<p>This is Clear Water Temple itself, with a view of Kyoto in the background. Built in 1633, it is a magnificent piece of carpentry.</p>

<p>Massive pieces of timber were used and lots of fancy joints.</p>

<p>This picture is actually quite misleading as autumn was long over.<img src="http://phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PC123671.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>We then took the bus to nearby Gion.</p>

<p>Of all the places we visited, I was most impressed by Nijo Castle and its surrounding gardens.</p>

<p>A simple breakfast.</p>

<p>Japanese knives are only ground on one side (chisel grind) and hence are either left or right handed. This was part of the left handed offerings.</p>

<p>We then went to a ryokan on Lake Biwa, the largest freshwater lake in Japan,<img src="http://www.phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PC144095.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>and played camping.<img src="http://www.phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PC144143.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>A private spa in the ryokan.<img src="http://www.phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PC154157.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>A bit of a feast with Japanese marbled beef, sashimi and crab.<img src="http://www.phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PC144121.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>Following the visit to Lake Biwa, we went to Kyoto station and took the train to Osaka.<img src="http://www.phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PC144082.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>In Osaka, it is easy to tell which restaurants specialise in what food.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PC154205.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>Didn’t try this.</p>

<p>Noodle bar.<img src="http://www.phwl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PC1541821.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>Overall, we had a great time in Kyoto and Osaka. This was the first time I’ve been there and I would definitely not pass up an opportunity to return.</p>
