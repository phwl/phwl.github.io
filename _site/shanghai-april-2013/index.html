<p>I had an excellent trip to Shanghai last year and wrote about it in  <a href="http://www.phwl.org/postcard-from-shanghai/">http://www.phwl.org/postcard-from-shanghai/</a>. I was fortunate enough to be invited back.</p>

<p>I stayed in the Expert building, Zhangjiang Campus.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2013/04/IMG_2402.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>This is the library.<img src="/assets/images/2013/04/P4232072.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>There were many highlights to this visit. Chen Shuai kindly accompanied me to visit the former residence of Soong Ching Ling, Sun Yat-sen’s wife (we also went to Sun Yat-sen’s former residence but that was not as interesting).</p>

<p>Soong Ching Ling was someone I greatly admire, She had friends like Stalin, who gave her this car.</p>

<p>This was one of her favourite books.</p>

<p>This was a very impressive giant moving display of village life.<img src="/assets/images/2013/04/P4212009.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>We went to little supermarkets,</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2013/04/P42119131.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>and a huge mall</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2013/04/P4212063.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>This time, I also had an opportunity to visit the main campus of Fudan University.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2013/04/P4242092.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>At 30 storeys, this is the tallest university building in Asia. We went there for coffee.<img src="/assets/images/2013/04/P4242100.jpg" alt="" class="align-center" /></p>
