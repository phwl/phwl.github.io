abstract = {The spectral correlation density (SCD) is an important tool in cyclostationary signal detection and classification. Even using efficient techniques based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT), real-time implementations are challenging because of the high computational complexity. A key dimension for computational optimization lies in minimizing the wordlength employed. In this article, we analyze the relationship between wordlength and signal-to-quantization noise in fixed-point implementations of the SCD function. A canonical SCD estimation algorithm, the FFT accumulation method (FAM) using fixed-point arithmetic, is studied. We derive closed-form expressions for SQNR and compare them at wordlengths ranging from 14 to 26 bits. The differences between the calculated SQNR and bit-exact simulations are less than 1&nbsp;dB. Furthermore, an HLS-based FPGA design is implemented on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ XCZU28DR-2FFVG1517E RFSoC. Using less than 25\% of the logic fabric on the device, it consumes 7.7&nbsp;W total on-chip power and has a power efficiency of 12.4&nbsp;GOPS/W, which is an order of magnitude improvement over an Nvidia Tesla K40 graphics processing unit (GPU) implementation. In terms of throughput, it achieves 50&nbsp;MS/sec, which is a speedup of 1.6 over a recent optimized FPGA implementation.},

Integrated photonic circuits positioned at the nodes of a quantum network can perform the important functions of generating highly entangled photons and precisely manipulating their quantum state. In this Letter, we demonstrate time-bin entangled photon generation, noise suppression, wavelength division, and entanglement analysis on a single photonic chip utilizing low-loss double-stripe silicon nitride waveguide structures. Quantum state tomography results show 91\&\#x00B1;0.7\% fidelity compared with the ideal state, indicating that highly entangled photons are generated and analyzed. This work represents a crucial step toward practical quantum networks.},

Phys. 19, 063013 (2017\] has proposed a relative multiplexing scheme that can enhance the N single photons probability with a minimum of active switching resources. We experimentally demonstrate relative temporal multiplexing on two photon sources with a 90\% additional enhancement over the standard temporal multiplexing scheme demonstrated previously. 88 {\textpm} 11\% visibility of Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum interference verifies the indistinguishability of the heralded single photons after the synchronization. This proof-of-principle demonstration points out the potential significance of the relative multiplexing scheme for large-scale photonic quantum information processing.},

We propose an adaptive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) control scheme to stabilize the operation wavelength of on-chip wavelength demultiplexers that have many applications in photonic-chip-based optical signal processing. Using the MIMO control scheme, the wavelength drift is reduced from 0.5 to 0.1 nm when internal and external thermal disturbances occur.},
