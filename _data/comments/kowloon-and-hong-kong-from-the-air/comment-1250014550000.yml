  I love the ones taken from Sheraton Hotel and after the storm.


  The others are good also, the one from the plane is spectacular.


  It makes one feel so nostalgic about the island.


  Well done, Philip! Hope you get some more good shots eg from the peak, on the
  adjacent islands of Hong Kong and the country side or the Eleven and A Half
  Miles Beach etc.
