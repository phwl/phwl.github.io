  You can moonlight as a writer. I always enjoy reading about your adventures.


  After staying ony 12 days in H.K. when I return home to Toronto, I notice the
  change in pace but I like it slow now (getting old, definitely). I don't mind
  waiting for my luggage at the airport. Never mind 12 yrs.


  We are expecting Uncle Ken's arrival next Friday. He is flying to Miami on
  Oct. 5 and I am flying to Madrid same day.
