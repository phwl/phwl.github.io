  always fun on a fishing trip. My memory is that one time I went fishing in a
  lake in Sask. Canada. My scarf was blown away and before I knew it the fishing
  boat landed on top of a hill and we had to carry it back to the water. Always
  fished from early morning till dusk, no quota in the late 70's.


  Wish I could taste the bream. What a catch, Philip.
