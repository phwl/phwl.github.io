message: "Great collection of images.  \r\n\r\nThe weather held off for us, the day was well attended and the site enabled HF to work reasonably well when propagation allowed.  Much better than last year.  We made HF contacts to the US West Coast, New Zealand, New Caledonia and a number of NSW states.  Both 40m and 20m were active at different times during the day.\r\n\r\nI also liked Bob's balloon payload which provided amusement as it regularly snapped images of various people walking past and transferred the images to the ground station which could display the images and telemetry on the big screen TV."
